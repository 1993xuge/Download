{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Your inner light is shining very brightly this week, Pisces, and you might draw someone else into your life who can see how incredibly special you are, dear Pisces. Whether this is a friend or a possible romantic partner will be up to you, but you should feel the vibrations of positivity and hopefulness surrounding you when this occurs. You have a tendency to be impulsive at times, so just take your time in getting to know someone new, or you may reveal too much of your inner world too quickly. Home improvements, car repairs, or an upgrade in these areas could come up this week. Although there may be some cost involved that you had not planned on, if you do your research, you should find it to be manageable. Besides, there are signs that money could be coming to you soon, either through a promotion at work, the payoff of an investment, or simply a windfall of some kind. If you have been contemplating a big move that involves making money with a talent of yours - such as selling your paintings or jewelry that you designed or some other artistic venture, take a step in that direction this week. You may find that others will be very receptive to your work. Don't let a past failure hold you back from accepting a chance to do something exciting. You may have a hard time envisioning success when the last effort was not successful, but if you look at this optimistically, you will begin to become enthused and courageous.","interval":"2020w08","reqDate":"2020w08"}]}
