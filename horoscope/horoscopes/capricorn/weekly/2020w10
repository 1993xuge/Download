{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may be in the mood for a slower pace and a winding down of busyness, but this could actually end up being a week of new beginnings for you. A potential new venture may represent an amazing opportunity that you will not want to miss, so stay on your toes and take advantage of any big and important offers that may come your way. One of these chances could involve travel, although it may not be all that far away. There could be the need to meet up with someone to learn more about what is involved. You may be enjoying a greater sense of freedom and autonomy at work or in your business life now, and that's a good thing for you. You happen to be very independent, Capricorn, and you like to be in charge of molding your ventures to match your style of doing business. Just be sure to include anyone else in your thoughts who may have some pull. A key person in your personal life may be tired of your focus on all work and no play, and that may come to a head this week. You may want to choose to spend some extra time with this individual. If you think about it, this is someone who is very important in your life, and you don't want to take them for granted - just as you would not want to be taken for granted. Surely you can carve out some time in your busy schedule to have a bit of fun with someone who is special to you. Show your caring side this week.","interval":"2020w10","reqDate":"2020w10"}]}
