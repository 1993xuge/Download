{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"An authority figure in your life sometimes seems to make your life miserable on purpose. You may even think that this person has it out for you. This may have been going on for quite a long time, Capricorn, and you may feel that you are at your breaking point. But this month, you may get a glimpse of why this person pushes you so hard, and why your suspicions are based on wrong assumptions. This tough love might be coming from admiration rather than resentment or dislike. Be grateful for it. You can become stronger and more skilled through this. A bit of serendipity could put you in the right place at the right time to make a deal or meet someone who can help you make your life more secure financially. This may seem almost too good to be true at first, so do explore it fully - but you should find that it is everything it seems to be and then some. The fast pace that happens this time of year may have left you feeling agitated and constantly on edge. But now that the year is coming to a close, it is time to settle down and recognize that the rush is over. Find a warm way to wind down and enjoy life with special friends. Doing this will put you back into shape emotionally. An artistic friend may encourage you to join a class or attend a seminar where you can reawaken your own creative spirit. This would be especially good for you right now. A chance to join a club or organization of some kind could come to you this month. This might benefit you not just personally, but also professionally.","interval":"2020m01","reqDate":"2020m01"}]}
