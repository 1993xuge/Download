{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Before you draw a line this week and tell someone not to cross it, you should spend a lot of time contemplating that decision. You may not be able to take the words back if you draw a boundary in concrete, and it could lead to the deterioration of a relationship. Instead, Pisces, try to work at being more flexible and less judgmental. You are not a judgmental person by nature, but you may have been hurt in some way in the past, which is causing you to see someone in a strangely filtered light that is not all that accurate. Give yourself some time to think this over, as this is not a good week for making this type of decision. If a money limitation has been on your mind, take your thoughts seriously. You need to take greater control over your finances to avoid problems in the future. If you choose to get financial counseling, you will learn how you can gain control over a money matter that will leave you feeling more secure. You are a dreamy soul, but you will need to call on common sense late in the week if a friend or an acquaintance attempts to involve you in a risky endeavor. Trust in your gut feelings about this, and if something does not feel right to you, then perhaps you will be better off refusing to participate.","interval":"2020w17","reqDate":"2020w17"}]}
