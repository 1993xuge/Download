{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"If you are in the market for a new job or a career change, Libra, this could be a great week to put your fishing line in the water. There is a lot of positive energy surrounding your work life now, and you may find something where you can blend your personal interests with a lucrative and very rewarding career. Start exploring. If you believe everything you hear this week from someone who is offering a get-rich-quick scheme or a pie-in-the-sky invitation, it could backfire and set you up for serious disappointment. Believe none of what you hear and only half of what you see this week, because you may find yourself in the company of a charmer who could sell anything given the chance. Just check out anything thoroughly if you don't have first-hand knowledge that you are making a safe bet. You are a very giving person, and you may be feeling especially inclined to give back right now. However, this week you need to be especially aware of what you have the power and the resources to do and what would be going over the limit. Don't give until it hurts. Even a small gesture and a kind word can be incredibly meaningful to someone who needs it. A lost possession or even a lost phone number or contact information could turn up this week. Before this gets lost again, you need to get a bit more organized - and this week could be great for that as well.","interval":"2020w08","reqDate":"2020w08"}]}
