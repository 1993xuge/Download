You have felt trapped in this by obligations that you should not have had to carry, but something that is said or done this week could set you free. Once you are free, though, don't go out unwittingly seeking the same thing all over again because it's comforting on some level. You are very deserving of something better. Unexpected good fortune could come to you this week in a serendipitous way. You may find that a stroke of luck could hit you out of the blue at a very opportune moment. Revel in this and don't question its authenticity. You may have to deal with a very mundane, monotonous chore this week, and you may wish it was already over with. But when you do that, you are wishing away precious moments of your life. Instead, try to find something to learn and something to enjoy in the experience, and you won't dread it at all. You will feel hopeful and enthusiastic about it instead. A welcome change could arrive at work or on the home front by the end of the week, clearing up something that has been perplexing.","interval":"2019w47","reqDate":"2019w47"}]}
