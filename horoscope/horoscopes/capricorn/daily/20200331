{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"It is always wise to be positive. But you must also be realistic. If, for example, you attribute all positive belief in something that needs to change or that needs work, you may unintentionally overlook aspects of what you are doing that could be better.

Just be sure that you don't ignore any issues that need to be dealt with, and pay close attention to what needs to be refined. Remain positive, but observant.","interval":"20200331","reqDate":"20200331"}]}
