{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Your life may have seemed rather scattered and uneven in recent weeks, Libra, which is something that makes you feel disconnected and out of sorts. You like balance, more than most signs, and you don't feel at your best when you are experiencing any kind of disorder. This week, things should begin to settle down, and you should be able to see your way clear up with a new and more reliable path. If you are feeling anxious, take some time to work on harmony in whatever approach is most desirable. You should find yourself feeling calmer and calmer as the week progresses. Security, in relation to a work-oriented matter, may be on your mind this week. It may have to do with security and uncertainty, and although there may not be an answer to this particular worry right now, you are headed in a good direction that will take you to the sense of security you are craving. Set your worries aside and just keep putting one foot in front of the other, and you will be fine.","interval":"2020w16","reqDate":"2020w16"}]}
