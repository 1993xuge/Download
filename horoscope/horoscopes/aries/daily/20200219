{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Common sense - of which you have a fair amount - will be the most important tool in your emotional toolbox today, dear Aries. That's because the main thing that causes you to lose your command of common sense is your emotions. If you keep your emotions in check today and avoid giving in to overwhelming feelings of anger or frustration, you will be able to see the situation very clearly and do the right thing. But if you allow your emotions to carry you away, your common sense could fly out the window, opening you up for trouble. Stay cool and level-headed above all today.","interval":"20200219","reqDate":"20200219"}]}
