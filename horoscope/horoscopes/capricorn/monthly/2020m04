{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"A confrontation this month could turn into an illuminating moment. While you may be all geared up for a fight over something you see as a moral issue or one that involves fairness or justice, you may discover that you and the opposing party are really on the same side after all. So, someone who starts out as an antagonist could actually turn out to be more of a partner. You have relied on someone else to help you with something that you find challenging, Capricorn. But this month you may find that this person is not there for you as usual, and you will have to follow through on your own. Although that might seem like a disaster at first, it could show you how well you can do when you try, and when you are confident, so you won't be dependent on anyone in this area of your life in the future. Tidying up an old business or personal matter may be of the utmost importance to you in April. It may seem at first that you don't have everything you need to tie up loose ends, but if you persevere and keep moving forward despite a lack of resources, you should find that it will all fall into place, and whatever you need will come to you at the time you need it. A younger person may turn to you for guidance and companionship this month. Although you may feel out of your element, the more time you spend with this person, the more you will realize that this could be an important mission for you, and that you may learn just as much if not more than the one you are mentoring.","interval":"2020m04","reqDate":"2020m04"}]}
