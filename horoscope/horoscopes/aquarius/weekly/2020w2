{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may have some worries connected to work this week or to whatever it is that governs your sense of financial security. You are probably making something out of nothing though, Aquarius, and so you need to step back and analyze where your fears are coming from. Your forecast for financial well-being is actually quite good right now, so set aside those thoughts and concentrate on where you see yourself in your career or with your finances, for you can make it happen. What's more, maintaining a spirit of optimism will bring these things to you more quickly. You could wind up in an unexpected meeting this week with someone who can do you some good, and being pleasant, positive, and outgoing will benefit you in this exchange. Just think happy thoughts and assume the best, and the best will be. This week offers a perfect time to share your deepest feelings with someone you care for. Perhaps you have been holding back on this for fear of revealing the depth of your emotions, but you should discover that this person's feelings are reciprocal, which will be very gratifying and well worth the risk of being vulnerable. You are perpetually hard on yourself, and you may already be chastising yourself for not starting on your New Year's resolutions. If you are feeling motivated this week, then simply start working on a plan to set things in motion.","interval":"2020w02","reqDate":"2020w02"}]}
