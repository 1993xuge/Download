{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"A sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu or familiar memories you can't quite place may be calling you to wonder about the past. This week, you may be extra focused on these thoughts, perhaps because of some comment you overhear, something you watch, or just your mind's wanderings. Whether you can identify the source of this or not does not matter, Aquarius, because it is a sign that you need to delve into what these thoughts can show you. There may be some enlightenment available to you now that can come to you through these musings. You may have been hoping for closure on some aspect of your life for a long time. This likely has to do with a relationship, but it could also have to do with some ending that didn't seem fair or even understandable. But by expecting closure to come through someone else, you are giving your power away as you are reliant on the other person's input. In reality, you have the power to come to terms with this and achieve closure on your own. Simply by thinking it through and choosing to let it go, you can free yourself. This is the perfect time for some contemplation on this matter. You may be able to set yourself free rather easily.","interval":"2020w16","reqDate":"2020w16"}]}
