{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You can be very flamboyant at times, Pisces, with an extravagant way of expressing yourself. But when your insecurities kick in, you sometimes put on a show trying to blend in with those around you. However, this week especially, it will be important to be nothing but yourself, for you are so beautiful and interesting when your true colors fly free. By being authentic, you will attract the opportunities and the people into your world that are best suited for you. Remember that always, but especially right now. You may be very hung up on an old issue that you can't seem to work out in your mind. But the reason you can't work this out may be that you have not discussed the matter with someone who has an integral role in whatever happened. By concentrating on this without that person's input, you are only contemplating one piece of the puzzle. Reach out, and you may find that the other party also has a deep need to get this sorted out. Try to let your guard down while out on a date or in a social gathering with new people in your life. By feeling free to express yourself and to just have fun, you will show off your fluid personality, and you will draw others in toward you. Even if you are feeling shy, there is no reason to hold back on expressing some of your wild dreams and ideas - in fact, you're likely to be commended and loved for it!","interval":"2020w02","reqDate":"2020w02"}]}
