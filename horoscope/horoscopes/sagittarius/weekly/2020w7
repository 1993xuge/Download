{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"If you have been hoping for a raise or recognition for something you have worked hard for, this is the week to call it to someone's attention. You are deserving of praise and reward, and you may not get it if you don't speak up. You aren't usually shy about things like this, Sagittarius, because you are so direct in the way you relate to others. But calling attention to your accomplishments, in this case, needs to be done in a more understated way so that you don't make others feel resentful or jealous of what you have achieved. You may not have shown off your stellar personality when among a new group. This may be among co-workers, a club you joined, or a new group of friends. And you may have been more subdued as you have tried to fit in. But this week, you may have more of a chance to shine, so don't hold back. A conflict between two friends or family members may put you in an awkward position this week, but dealing with it directly may not be the best way to proceed. It would probably be better to step away quietly and allow them to work it out on their own. If you get involved, it might be perceived as taking sides, which could make the conflict even more intense. Just wait for the dust to settle, and all will be fine. There may be a few new relationships in your life right now, and this week you could find yourself growing closer to at least one new person. This could be the beginning of a really strong friendship.","interval":"2020w07","reqDate":"2020w07"}]}
