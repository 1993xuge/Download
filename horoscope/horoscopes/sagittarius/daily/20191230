It isn't that you are feeling down, Sagittarius, but you may have had an intense few days, and you need to wind down. By taking care of yourself in this way, you can maintain the good vibrations you have been feeling, and you can look forward to launching the new year with a happy and hopeful attitude. If you can't completely relax like this today, do something else for yourself today, but try to do something that will help you relax and keep the good mood going.","interval":"20191230","reqDate":"20191230"}]}
