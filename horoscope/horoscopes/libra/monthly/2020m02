{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"There may be opportunities this month for you to join a professional organization, a team, or a social club, the last of which could be related to an interest or a hobby. While you may feel that your schedule is already too full to get involved, Libra, this could be good for you in so many ways. The demands may not be that great, and even dedicating a small amount of time to this could prove to be beneficial. You may have spent the last several weeks in some intense activities being very busy, but you should get the break you need around the second week or the middle of this month. Don't use this time to get involved in something else that is stressful. You need to be purposeful in seeking out ways to improve your well-being and your peace of mind. There is nothing wrong with doing nothing once in a while! You may get the answer you have been hoping for this month with an application that you put in quite some time ago. This may pertain to anything from a job application to an application for a loan or grant. You may receive some wonderful accolades in February or even a formal award of some kind for some work that you were very proud of but did not get fairly recognized for. Let this sink in so that you can feel the pride you deserve to feel and allow yourself to feel validated. The true colors of someone in your life may shine through this month, and this will bring great insight. Keep this in mind whenever you doubt what you have been feeling.","interval":"2020m02","reqDate":"2020m02"}]}
