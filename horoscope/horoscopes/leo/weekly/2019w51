{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"As is often the case with you, Leo, the joy you experience this week - and there should be quite a lot of it - will come through your experiences with close friends and family members. This is a great week to catch up with those you love but have not seen much of lately. This is also an excellent time to have some important one-on-one conversations with loved ones who bring a smile to your face. You may have the chance this week to increase your income in some way - perhaps through a promotion or a new job. You may also see that other offers, perhaps for possibilities further in the future, may come to you this week piquing your interest. Be sure to explore these as fully as possible before deciding on which opportunities to pursue. An authority figure may get on your last nerve this week, but be as reserved as you can be in your reactions. Becoming angry or temperamental will reflect badly on you, so remain even-keeled and calm and handle this from a logical rather than a passionate point of view. Someone may extend the olive branch to you this week in an effort to apologize for something. You may not feel ready to let this go, but try to do so anyway. This will free you from the agitation and resentment that has bogged you down in recent weeks.","interval":"2019w51","reqDate":"2019w51"}]}
