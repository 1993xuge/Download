{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"It is often said that if you fall off a horse, you need to get right back on again and ride. That's because waiting gives you time to mull over what occurred, to imagine a worse outcome, and to develop a fear that you might not have if you were to just get up and ride again. The horse in the saying is applicable to any endeavor in life of course. When we fail at something and dwell on what has happened, we tend to magnify it until it eventually seems worse than it is, or we play out all the worst-case scenarios. If you've had a bad experience recently, Virgo, just try again as quickly as you can. Be cautious and learn from mistakes, but don't let it scare you away. You'll be stronger for it.","interval":"20200331","reqDate":"20200331"}]}
