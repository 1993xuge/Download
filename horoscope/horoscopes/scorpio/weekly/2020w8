{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"If information that you receive on some purchase or investment you have been checking out this week does not come from a source you know, be sure to check out and validate the source and not just the information. You truly want to believe that you will hear nothing but good news on this, dear Scorpio, so you could easily delude yourself into believing something positive and hopeful that you hear. But you would be wise to remain open-minded and see this as objectively as possible so that you don't wind up disappointing yourself in becoming disillusioned. Even if some of the facts are not to your liking, that does not mean that this couldn't still be a good thing. This is a great week for self-pampering or for pouring your heart into an activity that you enjoy but rarely get to engage in. You have probably been a bit overwhelmed with work and responsibilities, and you may be stressed to the max. But losing yourself and allowing yourself to feel like a child indulging in something fun will restore your spirit. You have done a lot for one particular friend in recent months, and now it may be time when you need a favor. Don't hesitate to ask for help. You should find that your friend or loved one will be more than happy to step up and assist you. The week should end on a high note with news of an exciting event coming up in the near future. Be sure to say yes and to work it into your schedule.","interval":"2020w08","reqDate":"2020w08"}]}
