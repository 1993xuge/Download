{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may be brimming over with ideas about pursuing your big ideas of success and dreams-come-true. You may have a hundred good ideas, Aquarius, and you are ready to launch into getting all of them started this month. But it would be smarter and more efficient to pour yourself into only your favorite ideas - those that are the most meaningful to you, rather than going crazy trying to work on and keep making progress on a wide variety of goals. Distill your best into those things that appeal to you best, and you will be far more satisfied with yourself. You may realize that you have been editing yourself a lot lately, and not just with workmates or business associates, but also with the people who are closest to you. Perhaps you are not in the mood to get into a deep conversation or invite any judgments, but the stars are urging you to open up this month and be more willing to express your deeper emotions. When you do, others will do the same, and you will improve both communication and enjoyment of the relationship. You will also learn a few things you might not have learned otherwise. There may be a welcome change on the home front for you this month, and it may have to do with a living arrangement. This could mean moving in with someone, finding a new and lovely place to dwell, or even moving to a very special location you have often fantasized about. An excursion connected to work or money could bring new and interesting people into your world in January.","interval":"2020m01","reqDate":"2020m01"}]}
