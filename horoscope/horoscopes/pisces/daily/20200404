{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"When you seek absolute perfection - in a relationship, in a work of art, or in anything else of importance - you will never find it. That's because perfection does not lie in a single form. Perfection can take many forms, and you never know where or how you will discover it. If you are seeking perfection now in some important part of your life and you aren't finding it, dear Pisces, that may be because you have narrowed it down in your mind too definitively. You need to allow your heart to lead you on and not get caught up in what your dream looks like.","interval":"20200404","reqDate":"20200404"}]}
