{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You can probably feel energy and determination building within you. This week, Leo, you have an important mission to complete. You may have been wondering if you would ever be able to approach this and deal with it because it is something that leaves you feeling drained whenever you do so much as think about it. But almost from the moment you begin thinking about this again, you should feel a wave of energy pull you up and push you forward. Do your best to maintain your momentum, and you can accomplish this rather quickly. You have a lot to do this week, and because of that you may have created an airtight agenda to follow. You don't want to deviate from your plans one iota because you want to get everything done. But something may come up this week that will require your attention immediately. What you can do is reach out to someone who owes you a favor or someone who just wants to help and be there for you, and you can still accomplish all of your goals. Keep in mind this week that dwelling on fears of failure is like nurturing a failure. Instead, dwell on thoughts of success and happiness. This is what you deserve, and the universe is waiting for you to claim what is due to you. A mental block about something you have to get done can be melted away by simply taking some time each day this week to devote to relaxation. A warm bath with candles lit on the edge of the tub is a great way to start.","interval":"2019w50","reqDate":"2019w50"}]}
