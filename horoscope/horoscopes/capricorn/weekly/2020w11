{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may finally feel that you are ready to forge a partnership with someone who had been pressing you to do so for quite some time, Capricorn. But now that you are ready, the other party might seem reluctant. After all, your uncertainty on the matter did not build confidence, so if you are truly driven to accomplish this, you will need to share your passionate change of heart thoroughly. It will be worth it. A dream or a daydream that comes to you this week may contain the seeds of a really great idea. Some ideas may be fleeting or complicated, and you could easily forget all of the important details. Keep a notepad and pen handy at all times so that you can write your ideas down. A charismatic charmer may attempt to talk you into a big purchase or some kind of a big move that will take up a lot of your precious time this week. But if you are on guard, you will be wise enough to see through a scheme. Stay alert and if you have doubts, follow your intuition. If you need support on a personal matter this week, don't be shy about asking friends and family members to be there for you. You are not always obvious when you need this type of support, so this will be a great chance to share more of your deeper thoughts, which will allow greater closeness in some of your important relationships.","interval":"2020w11","reqDate":"2020w11"}]}
