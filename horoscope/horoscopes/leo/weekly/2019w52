{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may feel like dropping all of your responsibilities this week and heading to a tropical island or perhaps a mountain getaway. You may even find yourself making plans of a similar nature in your mind. But you can't run away from something that is bugging you, Leo, or from a problem that you need to resolve. It will follow you wherever you go. Wouldn't it be better to face this head-on, fix whatever is wrong, and then enjoy that wonderful escape with a clear mind and a full heart? Work on that this week. This is a great week to let others in on a secret talent you have hidden away. An opportunity may come up which will give you the stage to show off your special talents. And being someone who loves the spotlight and is very comfortable as the center of attention, this should be a welcome and very enjoyable moment for you. This may lead to something bigger as well. Your schedule may have been so jammed with obligations, commitments, and items on your own to-do list that you have barely had time to breathe let alone accomplish a small goal you promised yourself you would pursue. But late in the week, that chance to breathe should come to you, and you need to take full advantage of that moment to start working on that promise to yourself.","interval":"2019w52","reqDate":"2019w52"}]}
