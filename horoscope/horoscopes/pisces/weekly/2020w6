{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You have an allure about you, Pisces, much like the sea. You can be deep and mysterious, and you are also inspiring and intriguing. As a water sign, you are quite intuitive and can also be moody, but you are someone that everyone knows they can count on for your constant loving care. This week, you may find more than one friend or family member who is in need of that special brand of love and spellbinding inspiration that you alone can provide. At the same time, you may feel a deep need for the same thing from someone as well. Helping someone else out, though, can give you back exactly what you are providing. You can find solace through helping others find solace. Meanwhile this week, you may want to put the brakes on a plan that seems to be progressing too rapidly. Perhaps you were so enthusiastic that you got started haphazardly, and now you may feel that you are floundering without the confidence you should have to keep going. So, take a deep breath and slow down. Enjoy this experience and learn what you can. There is no deadline. Money matters have been on your mind, and this week there could be a solution to a goal or a challenge you have been facing with your finances. This may involve a project that could bring in extra cash, or it could be about turning an interest or talent into some extra income, or even a bigger money-making venture.","interval":"2020w06","reqDate":"2020w06"}]}
