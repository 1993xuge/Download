{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may feel that you have few options related to your work or money situation right now, Sagittarius, but at some point this week, some new and very desirable options may open up for you. But before you jump at the first thing that appears positive, wait until you see all that will be available to you. You may find that there is more than one good choice. You may not want to engage in a conversation that someone initiates this week because you find this person irritating or tiresome, but there may be some important and useful information that you will learn. Remain open to this, be receptive and cordial, and it may present a solution to a problem. A change that is now occurring at home may not seem very appealing, but if you learn more about it, you may discover some not-so-obvious aspects that are quite good. Be open to this and try to be more enthusiastic about it. If you look forward to this with enthusiasm, you may see how this can be beneficial to you. It would be helpful to pour a lot of good energy into a relationship that may have grown dull recently. It isn't dull because anything has changed, but simply because there has been a lack of attention. Putting some more focus on this and spending some lighthearted time together can revive and restore this relationship to where it once was.","interval":"2020w05","reqDate":"2020w05"}]}
