{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Some people are just born lucky, right? Sometimes it does seem that way. But does that also mean that some people are just born unlucky too? If you adhere to that belief, Taurus, then right now you may feel as though you were born into the second group. Listen here, that is absolutely untrue. Even if you have had a few bad breaks recently, it is all about making the best of the hand you were dealt. There is no such thing as bad luck - only lessons that you learn or refuse to learn. Choose to learn from your experiences this week, and the future will be much smoother, and luckier indeed. An unsettling conversation could make you feel a bit paranoid about trusting a certain person. Something that is revealed could give you cause for pause, and you may wonder if this individual was ever trustworthy. That may be so, but keep in mind that this is not a lesson for you to be less trusting with everyone in the future. Most of the people in your life really are honorable. Don't allow one bad apple to spoil your whole outlook. A kind and thoughtful person could offer you assistance this week, and it's with something for which you have put off asking for help. If you say yes, you will not only receive the help you need, but you will give a few fulfilling moments to your helper. Don't be too proud to accept.","interval":"2020w11","reqDate":"2020w11"}]}
