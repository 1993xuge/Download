{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"As the year comes closer to an end, many people are stressed and frenzied in their efforts to get everything done. There is a lot of focus on family matters, but this too brings tension. And as people are going through all of their own little dramas this week, you may find that a lot of people will gravitate to you for the excellent advice you give and the support you so willingly provide. You have your own stress to deal with of course, but do what you can without overtaxing yourself. One word of advice: focus on the positive when handing out guidance rather than dwelling on the negative, for it will be inspiring rather than limiting. This week could also bring you the chance to overcome a fear that has a connection to your self-confidence. This may come in the form of a challenge that you don't think you can rise to, but by summoning your courage, you will show yourself what tough stuff you are made of. A wild new idea for a business or a way to increase your income could come to you this week. While this may seem a bit far-fetched at first, if you explore this further, you may find a way to make it happen. A self-indulgent friend or loved one may want to be the center of attention in a group gathering this week, and you may be the one who has to get things back on track. Luckily, you have a way of expressing difficult lessons in an encouraging way, and this will be a great time to do that.","interval":"2019w50","reqDate":"2019w50"}]}
