Or at the very least, you may hear the beginnings of hopeful conversation that will make you feel a lot better about something you had given up on. Don't allow anyone to change your mind about this or bring up arguments to the contrary. You have every reason to hope that this will resolve in a positive way. You could have the urge to engage in a talent of yours that you rarely use or reveal. If you feel the desire, then start exploring. This may be a talent that can bring something good into your life - that may be anything from a therapeutic benefit that helps you work through issues, or it may even be something that can become lucrative for you in the future. Don't assume that someone's \"bad reputation\" is the absolute truth. You may hear something this week that leaves a bad impression, but you could assign what you hear to the category of gossip and find out for yourself instead. That's something that is advised.","interval":"2020w14","reqDate":"2020w14"}]}
