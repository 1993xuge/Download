There are people out there who believe that harsh words and pointed criticism will get someone to do their best, but for many people, it might actually make them so self-conscious that they can't do anything close to average, not to mention their best.

If you have been critical of something you accomplished, praise yourself for your efforts and inspire yourself by reflecting on your many wonderful talents. Motivate yourself positively.","interval":"20200409","reqDate":"20200409"}]}
