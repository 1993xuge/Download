{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Are you seeking guidance now, Pisces? If you have a need for important guidance from the universe, you may find yourself in greater communion with your spiritual guides this week. By being more observant of the world around you this week, by doing something that reaches your soul - whether that is listening to classical music, being out in nature, or anything else - you can witness clues and signs that will guide you in the right direction. If you make this goal a priority, you can gain the insight that you need so much right now. The request of a big favor could come to you this week - or perhaps just the implication of such a need. Someone may be afraid to ask for something big knowing that you are busy and preoccupied with your own obligations. However, this could be something that will be both fulfilling and life-affirming for you. If you can find the time, and you do feel inclined to help, it might be a very good thing for you. A message you receive this week might be pointing toward a very specific conclusion as you make an assessment about someone in your life. However, it may not be as conclusive as it appears at first. Be very careful as you sift through the facts.","interval":"2020w14","reqDate":"2020w14"}]}
