{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Keep in mind that less is more this week when a chance to impress someone comes to you. You may believe that going after your goal in a big and flashy way will be most impressive, but in reality, Libra, all you need to do is be yourself without the bells and whistles and your talent will shine true. You may find yourself in a situation this week with new people - perhaps in a learning environment. While you may feel a bit intimidated, just try to remember that by being yourself, you will draw the right people into your life. Your tribe will recognize when you are authentic. This is the very best way to attract new friends, potential romantic interests, and even those who can assist you in making your dreams come true. Holiday or other gatherings may take up a lot of your time and attention this week. Although you may be able to think of about a hundred other things you could and\/or should be doing, you really should take some time to celebrate now. All work and no play can make any experience pretty dull, so take some time to party and enjoy yourself. If you have a little extra money this week, then buy yourself a small but special gift. It doesn't have to be expensive; it can just be something that reminds you to smile and to stop and smell the roses.","interval":"2019w52","reqDate":"2019w52"}]}
