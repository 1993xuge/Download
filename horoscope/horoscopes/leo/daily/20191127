However, it can also sound an alarm when the oven gets too hot and smokes. This is what is called a \"false positive\" and it can be annoying of course, but the overall value of protecting you and your family makes it worth it. Sometimes, Leo, our minds send us a false alarm when something seems to be wrong, alerting us to not trust a person or a situation, just as this can happen with a smoke alarm.
