{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"There is nothing wrong with shameless self-promotion when you need to get something done. That may be exactly what you will need to do this week to accomplish the launch of a brilliant idea of yours, dear Scorpio. You are a private person of course, but showing off your talents doesn't have to be all that deeply or personally revealing of your inner workings. Get out there onto center stage and show off what you do best, and someone who will be noticing could help pave your way to success. Your financial status may be in focus this week too. You may be concerned either about saving more for your future, or by not overspending now - during the time when you might tend to overspend. Just keep a constant eye on a well-planned budget, and don't stray from the promises you make to yourself about keeping your wallet in check - and you will be fine. There should be at least one moment this week when something wonderful happens that you have been waiting on for a long time. This may be anything from getting the attention of a potential employer to landing an opportunity you have been dreaming of. Seize the moment when it arrives. If there is someone in your life who does not make you feel appreciated despite your countless efforts to do well by them, this is a good time to speak up about it. You deserve to be acknowledged and appreciated in any relationship, and tolerating less than that is not acceptable. Cap off your week by saying yes to any social invitations that seem appealing. There could be someone interesting there who you find captivating.","interval":"2019w52","reqDate":"2019w52"}]}
