{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"A transformation is possible in a key area of your life this week, Gemini. You have been hoping to expand beyond certain boundaries that you feel have held you back. These boundaries may have been erected by you out of fear of failure. But a small success this week could launch a new beginning and help you build your confidence to move forward. It is easy to tell someone to believe in themselves, but this week you will have added support and inspiration to draw on - so work on this. A long-overdue apology could come to you this week. You may, at first, feel resentful that it took so long, and you may not want to accept someone saying they are sorry. But everyone learns and grows at a different pace. The idea that someone wants to make something right should be enough for you to accept a humbling apology. It will do you just as much good to forgive as it will do the other party to be forgiven. Allow yourself to let this go and be generous in your response. In many ways, you are on the precipice of a new chapter in your life. You are growing emotionally. You are taking better care of yourself. You are evolving spiritually. And this is all leading you to the edge of something new and exciting. It would be easy to stop yourself because this feels like new territory and you are apprehensive, but be brave anyway. Good things lie ahead.","interval":"2019w49","reqDate":"2019w49"}]}
