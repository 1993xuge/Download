{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You always believe in reaching for what you want without explanation or apology. But this month, Scorpio, you may want to keep a big goal of yours under wraps - at least for the time being. Someone in your inner sphere might not understand your desire to get involved, but once they see how happy the pursuit of this goal makes you, they will be all in. You are someone who understands the power of belief very well, but with a current venture, you need to be careful about closing your eyes to any negative elements. If you aren't realistic and perhaps a bit pessimistic about some aspects of this situation, you may not be able to see how you can protect yourself and how to rise above the troubles to make this a success. This is a great time to ask someone for a favor you have been in need of. People are feeling hopeful at the start of the year because it seems like a new beginning for everyone. If you aren't shy about showing how much you care about this, you could develop a fan club of sorts and people would go to great lengths to help you meet your goal. Real estate or other big purchases are favored in January. Even if you have not thought about a serious purchase, it may come to you in some way that makes you start considering it seriously. Just be slow to move with this because a large amount of research may be needed to do the best thing - especially if this turns out to be an investment rather than a purchase for personal pleasure.","interval":"2020m01","reqDate":"2020m01"}]}
