{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"The stars are luring you out of your comfort zone this month, dear Aries, and while it may feel uncomfortable at first, it won't be long before you are very grateful for the changes your bravery brings to your life. This may mean meeting new people you would never have crossed paths with before, exploring ideas that you would have thought were outside of the realm of possibility, and considering a path that you were too afraid to travel before. While these things could ultimately bring you new opportunities, the experiences alone will be valuable to you on their own. You may also have experiences in December that show you the power of your thoughts and your words. Something you have spoken aloud with hope and strength should begin to manifest in your life, proving to you that you are in control of your destiny, and showing you how powerful positive thinking can be. A work or a professional relationship may also be in focus this month reconciling an old doubt and confirming something you suspected. This will not only bring clarity but the reassurance that your hunches were correct. A greater sense of contented abundance could settle in December. This may happen not so much because there is more that is tangible in your life - although that may be part of it - but mostly because you have a greater enjoyment of and appreciation for what you already have.","interval":"2019m12","reqDate":"2019m12"}]}
