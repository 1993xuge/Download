{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Mistakes and wisdom are two sides of the same coin, and if you can make that connection this week related to a mistake you regret from long ago, it could lead to an amazing discovery. You learned a valuable lesson that came through a difficult experience, Aquarius, but you should be grateful for it rather than ashamed. If you can hold your head high and feel good about gaining something positive from that time, then this week an appealing opportunity that comes to you will benefit greatly from your lesson. You may finally be wrapping up a project that had many stops and starts, but in your haste to finally get it all over with, you need to slow down rather than speed up. There may be a few loose ends that you hadn't counted on, and wrapping it all up neatly should be a priority - for this still stands a chance to bring you some good fortune. You may find yourself stoking the embers of an old passion and reigniting an interest that was once very important to you. Ideas for this may come through an experience you have this week, and it will reawaken those old feelings of hope and excitement. This is definitely something you need to pursue. If you were headed to a friend's house for a dinner party, and you had never been there before and got lost along the way, you probably wouldn't just turn the car around and go home. You would either ask directions or turn on your navigation device and find your way. You may be thinking of giving up on something because you took a wrong turn, but this week you really need to recognize that there is a better way to get there.","interval":"2020w03","reqDate":"2020w03"}]}
