{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may not see yourself as a creative person, Aries. And that is not because you are too humble to recognize your own talents. In fact, you are well aware of the areas in which you excel. But creativity may not be something you feel especially drawn toward. However, this week, you may inadvertently tap into one of your special undiscovered talents, and you may even have the chance to showcase it in some way in an area that is very familiar to you. This experience could launch you into a whole new period of creative discovery that might be very useful to you in the future. This week, you may have to condense a work effort that you usually do in a more drawn out way. You like to get things down perfectly, but you may not have the time to do things using your standard operating procedure. This might be annoying to you at first, but it could lead to a more efficient way of completing certain tasks. A negotiation or the effort of coming to an agreement of some kind could lead to a conflict between you and a business partner or someone else with whom you are discussing a money matter. You should be able to sense when things are headed in that direction, though, so cut it off at the pass by changing the direction and tone of the conversation. If you do that correctly, it should lead to a productive and successful conclusion.","interval":"2019w51","reqDate":"2019w51"}]}
