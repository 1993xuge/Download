You are a very observant sign, but first impressions aren't always accurate. If you were to meet someone on a day when they were just lazing around not doing much of anything but flopping on the couch and watching television, you would not assume this person was naturally lazy. Likewise, if you see someone working hard at some task relentlessly, you can't necessarily assume they are always that way. Someone you may meet soon could give you a strong impression, but before you align yourself with this individual, you have to do a bit more observing. You need to know more, Libra, because your time and your attention are too valuable to be wasted.","interval":"20200411","reqDate":"20200411"}]}
