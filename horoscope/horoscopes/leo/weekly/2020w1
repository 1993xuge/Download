{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may have been very aware recently of someone who was on a similar path as yours but who achieved greater success more quickly. But don't dwell on this in the week ahead, Leo, because there is no comparison. You are on two different paths, and yours is designed for you alone. Your experiences are all about personal evolution and transformation, and what you are learning now is very important to your future. Besides, you should find that you will catch up quite quickly, and probably surpass the success you are now comparing against your own. Someone may seek you out for your expertise in some area this week, and while you may be quite flattered, you might also feel a bit afraid to give guidance for fear of what will happen if it doesn't work out. But don't worry - you do know what you are doing, and helping someone out will bring a great sense of satisfaction. Be cautious with legal matters and anything involving a contract this week. If you can afford it, signing any documents should be put off until the following week. You should also be careful with money matters this week because one particular venture could offer a lot to gain, but proceeding with great care will be essential.","interval":"2020w01","reqDate":"2020w01"}]}
