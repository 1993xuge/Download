{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"An agreement you made with someone may not have gone as planned. Perhaps someone isn't holding up their end of the bargain, or perhaps they are not as capable as they claimed to be. But whatever the issue, Moonchild, you do have to look out for yourself. The stars advise you to have a level-headed, honest conversation about what is going on this week because this is an optimum time for this kind of communication. You may just find that this is something that can be worked out in a good way successfully, allowing you to continue on a team or in a partnership. If someone responds negatively to something you have been working on or to an idea you have shared, don't become self-critical. This is just one person's opinion, and you should not attribute some level of expertise or insight to it. If you believe in this, then you have the final word. And if you originally felt confident in this, then you should still feel confident about it now. Don't let anything stop you. At the end of the week take count of your proudest achievements, whenever they occurred, and celebrate yourself.","interval":"2020w16","reqDate":"2020w16"}]}
