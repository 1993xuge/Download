{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"This week should be easier than last week for you, Aquarius, because it will be marked with fewer delays and misunderstandings. In fact, communication in every area of your life should be smoother and easier in each and every way - something that will contribute to a greater sense of calm and peace of mind. Use this advantage to discuss an important matter that has been difficult to deal with in the past, and use it to present any ideas you have wanted to share with others. Your eloquence is highlighted, and your charm is enhanced, so any idea you wish to sell to anyone should be well-received. You may feel like lighting a fire under someone who has not been fulfilling their end of a deal. There may be some urgency to this matter, and perhaps you are beginning to panic. But becoming upset or panicked over this will only make things more stressful, which could even slow things down even more. If you approach this matter with a calm frame of mind and with a tone of encouragement rather than harshness or blame, you will accomplish your goal very well. Don't let stress dictate your choices or your moods this week because you have more control over how you feel than you may realize. Maintaining a calm composure this week will ensure a very productive and enjoyable week with many accomplishments.","interval":"2019w49","reqDate":"2019w49"}]}
