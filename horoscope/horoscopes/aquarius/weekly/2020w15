{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"This week, Aquarius, you may finally be able to find closure with a long-standing personal matter, most likely having to do with a relationship. Either this bond changed or ended for some mysterious reason, and some revealing information may come to you soon. This may also offer you the chance to reconnect and fix whatever went wrong, though it may require you to reach out yourself. Books, publishing, or records of some sort may come up for you at some point this week requiring you to set aside whatever else you are doing and address this matter. Resolving this will happen quickly as long as you deal with it immediately. You put a lot of good will and effort into something quite some time ago that did not work out, perhaps because someone wronged you. You may have hoped for good karma to return the positivity that you invested, and this week you may see that pay forward karma arrive in another form. You should recognize it as such when it does arrive. Networking with like-minded individuals on an interest of yours could help you take an idea to a profitable place. Don't underestimate the great power of having good connections, even though you are a rather independent thinker.","interval":"2020w15","reqDate":"2020w15"}]}
