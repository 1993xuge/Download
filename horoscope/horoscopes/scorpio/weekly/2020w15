There may be some metaphysical \"fog\" surrounding important conversations, so be as patient as possible to be sure that you are understood. You might even want to take it a step further and ask for feedback so that you can gauge someone's understanding of what you have to say. The winds of change are blowing through something in your life that has been stationary for a long time now. This may have to do with a home, a job, or something else that encompasses a nontrivial part of your life. And although you may be concerned by some upheaval, this is destined to turn out positively if you choose to treat it that way. By working up some enthusiasm and looking for all of the perks and benefits, you will begin to see why this change is really good for you. Spend some time this week concentrating on your physical fitness and on establishing routines that you can fit into your schedule each day. If you are especially busy, you can still find time to stay fit. You could, for example, do certain exercises immediately upon waking, take a short walk just after lunch, and so on.","interval":"2020w15","reqDate":"2020w15"}]}
