{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Pride is a two-sided coin. Being proud of who you are in the world and your values and character are essential to a good and productive life. But being too proud to admit when you have been wrong about something or when you have made a mistake can lead to your downfall. You are a morally upright person, Taurus, but this week you may face a situation where you could be called out for an error or a brief lapse of judgment. Since you always strive to do the right thing, this may be upsetting. But to deny this to yourself could prevent you from learning something very valuable and postpone forward movement to a better place in your life. We must all engage in lifelong learning. An offhand comment from someone you know could be taken in different ways. But before you choose to see it in a negative light, try to explore other possibilities. This is always a good pattern for keeping all of your relationships healthy and whole.","interval":"2020w13","reqDate":"2020w13"}]}
