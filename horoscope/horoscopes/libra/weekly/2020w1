{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You could meet someone new and interesting this week - at a party, a work-related function, or simply out shopping - someone who will feel like an old friend. This budding connection, whether it is romantic or platonic, could be a lasting one that you should take the time to nurture. Even though this may be a busy time of year for you, Libra, there are always a few minutes here and there to stay caught up. You and someone you care about is in need of pampering right now, and this week is a great time to schedule and hopefully fulfill that need. Take yourselves out to a nice dinner, a play, or a comedy show, and just kick back and enjoy. You deserve a few hours when you can just relax and laugh and enjoy each other's company. This will be good for the soul. If a party invitation arrives this week, be sure to say yes - even if there are multiple events to attend, you will find something fun and interesting at each one. Living life to the fullest is all about enjoying the people in your life that you care about. A new chapter in your life could open up late in the week through the chance to learn something new that could help you branch out into a new business or significant new hobby. This could invite changes in other areas of your life.","interval":"2020w01","reqDate":"2020w01"}]}
