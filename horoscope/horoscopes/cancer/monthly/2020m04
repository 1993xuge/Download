{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"If you had a train trip planned and you rushed to the station only to miss your train by a few minutes, you would probably be pretty upset. Supposed the next train wasn't coming for another few hours. That would be pretty upsetting because it might cause you to be late for whatever you planned, and it would also mean you would have to sit there at the station just thinking about your disappointment. And while sitting there pondering your disappointment might be one way to go, you could also make the most of that time by reading a book, engaging in conversation with another interesting traveler, taking photographs, or something else you enjoyed. Something you planned in detail may involve a disappointment this month, Moonchild, but will you spend your idle time feeling bad about it? Or will you find something interesting and exciting to do? The choice is yours. Although this month may hold one change of plans, many other things will fall seamlessly into place, including at least one that was not expected to work out. This may involve finances, major news on a change of residence, or something else that pleases you. Later in the month, you may receive interesting news that will shed light on someone you thought you knew. While this will explain a few things that mystified you, it will also open up a deeper camaraderie.","interval":"2020m04","reqDate":"2020m04"}]}
