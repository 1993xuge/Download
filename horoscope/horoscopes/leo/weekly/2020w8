{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Something you did for someone recently - even if it was something you consider small, Leo - had a profoundly heartwarming impact. And that impact was not felt just by the other party, but also by you. It feels good to be able to help someone when they need you the most. This week, you may have the chance to help someone again, and if you feel inclined to do so, then you should. However, be careful in how you go about it, or you could set a precedent with someone who doesn't have a good sense of boundaries. You are generous to a fault at times, and you can be taken advantage of because of your big heart - so just be careful. Your emotions may be difficult to control around the middle of the week - especially anger - when someone brings up a difficult subject or a matter from the past that you believed to be resolved. You should never hold anger in entirely, but you should express what comes to you in the moment. Take some time by yourself to decompress first, then consolidate your feelings into one succinct expression of how you feel - and leave anger out of it. If you stick to the facts, expressing your hurt, you will do well. At some point this week, a heartfelt message could arrive from someone you have not seen or heard from in a long time. This may arrive in an informal way, but it could reveal the depth of this person's admiration and respect for you, which should feel pretty good.","interval":"2020w08","reqDate":"2020w08"}]}
