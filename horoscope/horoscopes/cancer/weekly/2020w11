{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"We have all heard stories about people who were down on their luck and down to their last few dollars when they chose to spend their last money on a lottery ticket. Then, lo and behold, they wind up winning the big jackpot. Talk about going from rags to riches! Is that going to happen to you this week, Moonchild? Well, not literally in that way perhaps, but you could be feeling in a rut in some area of your life, and some small investment you make could lift you up in an amazing and incredible way. Enjoy the view from up there, and remember this whenever you are feeling low in the future. Many people of your sign are very careful with their security - especially their finances. If you overpay for something accidentally or because you have no other choice, it can linger and bother you for a long time. Well, overpaying with your time is even worse than overpaying with your money because money can be replaced, unlike time, which cannot be replaced. You have a risk of wasting your time on someone or something this week. But if you are aware of this and you are discerning in what you choose to do with your time, you can put your time toward something far more important like making one of your biggest dreams come true. And when you set off in that direction, you should find that good fortune will find you.","interval":"2020w11","reqDate":"2020w11"}]}
