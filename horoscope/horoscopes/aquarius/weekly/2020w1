{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You are a trusting person most of the time, Aquarius, but you need to be careful about sharing any personal or private information or anything you wish to remain secret. This week, there could be a chatterbox among the people you encounter who could easily spill your story. Discretion is advised, even among those people you find trustworthy. This slip of the tongue might not have malice attached, but it could be awkward nonetheless, so preventing it is important. This is a great week for personal development, whatever that may mean to you. This could mean thinking about a career change, about learning a craft, about becoming a more positive person, or really anything that can help you grow and evolve. News of an opportunity to do something like this could come to you this week. An opportunity that you were denied in the past - perhaps in favor of someone else - could come to you again this week. If you choose to pursue this again, you are very likely to achieve success this time. A meeting or get-together that you believe will be dull and boring - that you may want to make an excuse for - could actually turn out to be quite a lot of fun and very informative in some way. Take a chance and attend. A mentor could appear at just the right moment as you enter into a new endeavor for which you feel you need a guide.","interval":"2020w01","reqDate":"2020w01"}]}
