{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"As the month begins, Gemini, you may feel like traveling far under the radar. It is so unlike you to seek out solitary confinement, but this month you may be inclined to do just that. If you have been through a whirlwind in recent weeks, you will welcome some rest and rejuvenation. What's more, you also need to start coming up with some ideas for a plan you want to put into action this month. There may be some creativity involved in this, but there will also be a lot of financial and business forecasting to do as well. And you may want to consider bringing in a partner to help and to brainstorm with, and that will take a great deal of thought and consideration of the finer points of how well you two will mesh together. The resolution of a legal or work-related matter could be pushed this month by someone else, but you may not be ready to resolve this yet. There could be too many outstanding facts to consider - and you need to consider them all very carefully - before you come to a decision. This could affect the rest of the year, and you want to handle it the best way. If a family member comes to you with a problem this month, and this happens to be someone who has asked for and yet rebuffed your advice in the past, don't be judgmental and don't avoid them. This time they may finally be ready to listen to your valuable advice, and you can be very instrumental in helping this person out.","interval":"2020m03","reqDate":"2020m03"}]}
