{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Being thankful only occurs to some people when something big and joyful occurs in their lives. But there are so many small miracles that occur each day for all of us that we tend to overlook them: a smile from someone we like, a safe journey on the freeway, a nice dinner out with friends, and certain small blessings eventually lead to bigger ones. These common, everyday things are worthy of gratitude as well, Virgo. And the more thankful we are, the more optimistic and happy we are as a result and the more abundance and joy we invite into our lives. Think about what you are thankful for today, Virgo.","interval":"20200130","reqDate":"20200130"}]}
