{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Video games put the player in the center of the action. If they play a racing car game, even though it happens only in their imagination, players feel as though they are driving at breakneck speed around twists and turns. And although it isn't actually happening in the real world, it may help to sharpen one's reflexes and allow them to be more aware on the road when they get out there in a real car. What we do in our minds has a power that can apply in real life. If there is something now that you want to perfect, Virgo, meditate on it and see yourself working through it successfully over and over again. You can improve in this way.","interval":"20200114","reqDate":"20200114"}]}
