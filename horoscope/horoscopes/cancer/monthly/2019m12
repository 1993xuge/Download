{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"This can be a month of healing for you in many ways, Moonchild. Not only can you begin to heal your spirit from a lifelong hurt - which may come to you through a sense of spiritual guidance that infuses your mind with comfort and hope - you may also find that a breakthrough in a broken relationship is possible this month because your perspective has changed, and you are now able to see things more clearly through the other person's eyes. This level of compassion will have an impact on your whole life and your well-being. You may also find that a misunderstanding can be cleared up between you and a long-time friend or family member, which will bring a great sense of relief. You may have the chance this month to strengthen bonds with your colleagues or people you interact with often in a social setting. This chance may come through a group outing or a deep conversation that comes about in a fairly spontaneous manner. And of course, an enhanced connection can make every aspect of your work more enjoyable and can enhance team spirit. As the year comes to a close, it is a great time to look forward with hope and happiness toward the dreams you will have the chance to manifest in the year ahead. But first, you may need to bring order to your scattered dreams so that pursuing them will be easier and will make them more readily attainable. An old flame or a long-lost friend could come to mind late in the month, and they may have a message to share with you. Make sure you pay attention to it as it can be very important for both of you.","interval":"2019m12","reqDate":"2019m12"}]}
