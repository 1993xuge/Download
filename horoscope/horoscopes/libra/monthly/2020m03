{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"This is a great month to step outside your comfort zone from time to time. You have gotten used to playing it safe, Libra, and you may be getting bored with the routine, even though it does bring you a certain amount of comfort. There could be several chances in March for you to try new things, meet new people, and enjoy yourself in unusual social situations - and all of these chances would be great for building up your enthusiasm and for adding excitement to your life again. Be aware this month of maintenance issues as there could be a propensity for malfunctions, but you can remain safe by always having a back-up plan, making sure your car has its regular oil change, and taking care of any issues with home appliances and so on. Staying on top of these kinds of things will ensure fewer things could go wrong. A radical change may be possible this month in some area of your life where you have been dealing with a lot of aggravation. This may involve some aspect of your work life or some financial matter that has confounded and confused you. This change may not be complete this month, but you can make great headway if you focus on it. A long-lasting feud could begin if you aren't careful what you say later in the month to a sensitive friend or family member. Bite your tongue if the urge to lash out comes to you, or you may regret it for a long time to come. On a positive note, you can make a breakthrough in how you communicate with this person if you tune into the cues they give through both their body language and the things they say.","interval":"2020m03","reqDate":"2020m03"}]}
