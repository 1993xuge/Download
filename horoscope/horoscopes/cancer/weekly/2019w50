{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Taking care of yourself and reaching for what you need is almost never selfish in any way, Moonchild. You are someone who gives until it hurts when the people you love are in need. You rarely think of yourself when someone else is in need, but this week, you need to start taking better care of you and your own needs. You are in a stressful period now, perhaps because of an ending and a new beginning that are happening at the same time. This could be a big change for you, but it promises to be very rewarding and to bring great happiness to you and yours. You may gain a new perspective this week on an old matter, perhaps related to family or a close friendship. Some insight you find may allow you to take a broader view, which could result in a closer relationship and a better understanding of this person. It's time to break a habit that you are not happy with. This week, start seeking out ideas for rising above something about yourself that bothers you. Not only will you be healthier, but you will also be happier too. The instructions you received to complete some kind of a goal may not seem very clear. You have followed what you were told, yet it still doesn't seem to work. However, there may be a step missing. Go back to the source to figure out what might be missing. Following through right away is very important to getting this job done right.","interval":"2019w50","reqDate":"2019w50"}]}
