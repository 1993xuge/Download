{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"There are times, Virgo, when your logical mind gets in the way of your emotions. It isn't that you can't be emotional; in fact, you often are. But when presented with a matter that is emotionally charged, you tend to look for a rational answer as a means of dealing with it. That's because you don't like drama. But sometimes the only way to deal with an emotional issue is dealing with it emotionally. Someone in your world may need to understand how you feel. Don't be afraid to show them, and don't be afraid to connect to your inner self and your emotions on a deeper and more intimate level.","interval":"20200412","reqDate":"20200412"}]}
