{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may begin the week with anxious energy because you have so many irons in the fire. Juggling so much and keeping it all spinning will be quite a task, dear Gemini. But once you get things under control you should start to calm down and relax. As the week progresses, you may find that many chances to enjoy yourself may come along, including social activities and chances to participate in outings that hold great interest for you. There has been some distance slowly growing between you and a loved one. It may have begun over a small argument or a different point of view, and then it grew into something bigger but unspoken. This issue may come up this week, seemingly by chance, and you should take that opportunity to clear the air and work things out. Doing so will enable you to return to the way things were before. There may be a sense of suspicion or fear of being deceived this week with a matter related to money. Be sure to dedicate some time to look into this fully. You can either discover what has gone wrong and correct it, or you can invalidate your suspicions and feel better about it. The silver lining to a dark cloud that appeared in your life a few weeks ago may appear this week. A challenge that you dealt with may have seemed pointless, but once this revelation occurs, it will all make sense. Then you will see the upside and be grateful for it.","interval":"2019w51","reqDate":"2019w51"}]}
