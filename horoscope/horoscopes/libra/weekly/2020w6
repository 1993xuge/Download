{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You could face a few glitches with technology this week, or with other forms of communication. This could be a message for you to slow down and communicate in a more one-on-one kind of way. A phone conversation about a current topic would be better than an email exchange. And actual face time would be much better than the virtual type if there is something important that you want to discuss, Libra. We have all gotten so used to moving quickly that we often neglect the more personal aspects of conversations and relationships, both personal and professional. Your challenge this week is to go back in time to a more personable and communicative way of engaging. You may not be able to launch a project you have been hoping to begin this week, but there is nothing stopping you from fantasizing and imagining the good things that will come from your venture. In fact, you can start sending positive affirmations about it into the universe, which will give you a strong sense of immersing yourself in your future good fortune. Your social life could pick up a bit this week with either an unexpected invitation or the chance to host a gathering of friends or family members. You don't have to do this all by yourself. You could reach out to someone you know who enjoys party planning for some tips and ideas. You may have had the desire to champion a cause that is close to your heart in recent weeks, and this could be a great time to make that happen. Anything you start now in this regard has the potential to bring strong results. Seek out like-minded individuals and start brainstorming.","interval":"2020w06","reqDate":"2020w06"}]}
