{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"If it hasn't begun to happen yet, Scorpio, you should see a gradual improvement in some areas of your life this week. These areas may include career or your own business, a relationship that has experienced trouble in the past, and your reconciling of a problem that has been difficult to resolve. You will get the most out of these improvements if you remain patient and upbeat about each turn the road takes. Positivity will help you make the most out of the good things that are coming your way. You may find yourself regretting getting involved in a shared endeavor as complications develop, but if you can hang in there long enough to resolve the more pressing matters, you may do a complete turnaround and wind up feeling very grateful that you had the opportunity and the good fortune to get involved. You may have had the urge to get involved in something new and interesting - perhaps something that involves a long-treasured interest of yours. This week you may come upon an opening that will allow you to do just that. But don't think about it too long or put it off in favor of other obligations, or you could miss out on this chance. This could turn out to be just as exciting as you have envisioned. You should be able to see right through someone's ulterior motives later in the week when someone attempts to get you involved in a project where you can see a few red flags. Put more trust in your intuition.","interval":"2019w49","reqDate":"2019w49"}]}
