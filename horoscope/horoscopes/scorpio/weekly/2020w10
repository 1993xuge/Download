{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"This week, Scorpio, there may be the beginning of a very big expansion in some area of your life that will continue for quite some time. Although you may be frightened about this at first because it represents a big change from the familiar, once you step into it you will realize that it is powerfully positive for you, and you should find yourself feeling very excited about it. This could lead to other adventures and opportunities you might have never seen if you were not brave enough to take this on. Romance may be in the stars for you this week as well, and that should be very appealing to you, especially if your love life has been a little bit dull as of late. If you are attached, a romantic getaway could be on your agenda - or at least in the planning stages - and this could be the beginning of a new and better way of relating to each other. If you are single, you may meet someone who makes your heart skip and sing at the same time, and the attraction could be instantaneous. Charitable pursuits could be a topic of interest for you as well. You may have been thinking about giving back or \"paying it forward\" a lot lately, and you may meet someone who could open your eyes to a cause that is really meaningful to you. Before you make any commitments, however, be sure you have the time that will be demanded and plan accordingly. You can always expand later on if you have more time, but if you set a rigid and expansive schedule now, you might wind up over-extending yourself later on.","interval":"2020w10","reqDate":"2020w10"}]}
