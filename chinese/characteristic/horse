When Snake jumped ashore, she startled Horse. In typical Horse fashion, this majestic creature reared back, and Snake slithered across the finish line first. This story exemplifies how Horse may run with full speed, strength, and intent after goals, promises, and love interests, but can also scare easily. ","Chinese mythology contains stories of flying horses, horses that are part dragon or deity, and a silkworm/mulberry origin story wherein a girl promises to marry a horse if he helps her find her father. When found, the father murders the horse to preclude the marriage, and the girl and horsehide transform into a silkworm on a mulberry tree – thus even today, you can see a horse’s face on the silkworm.","Those born in the year of the Horse have inexhaustible energy (including potent sexuality), yet are easygoing, witty, honest, and outspoken. Horses are independent, adventurous, have a quick intuitive intelligence, and are good with money. They are decisive, generous, extremely popular, and can often be found in the middle of large social happenings. ","Horses are passionate about beginnings but don’t always stay beyond the first flush of enthusiasm – there’s always another challenge beckoning them. Since Horses can crave intimacy, love, and belonging as much as they’re repelled by feeling fettered, their major challenge is often unraveling their own psyche to help them find and sustain what truly nourishes and fulfills them. Horses can be impatient, impulsive, and self-centered."]},"success":true}
