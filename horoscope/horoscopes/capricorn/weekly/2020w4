{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may be feeling invigorated, inspired, and empowered from the very beginning of this week, Capricorn. This may be because you have been working on taking the reins of your life in recent weeks through meditation, self-hypnosis, affirmations, or positive thinking. Or, it could simply be because a wave of good fortune is coming in and is about to wash over you - and you can sense it. Good things are happening for you now, and this week you will begin to see the results. This could start as seemingly small things that begin to work out for you easily as people begin to recognize your talents - and as you find your place in the spotlight. Enjoy this time, but also maximize your power by utilizing every single opportunity that comes to you now. This is a perfect week to let go of any obligations that have kept you tied down or held back, because you will want to be free to do as you please and to be as creative as possible as new chances to show your talents show up on your doorstep. You may have a deeply emotional issue that you really need to delve into and discuss this week, but be very careful about who you choose to confide in. If you do want to discuss a personal matter, make sure you do so only with someone you are absolutely positive you can trust and who you are sure has your very best interests at heart.","interval":"2020w04","reqDate":"2020w04"}]}
