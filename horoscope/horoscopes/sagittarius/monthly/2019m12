{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may have thought that an opportunity you missed out on in recent months was gone forever. But in December, Sagittarius, you may find that this chance will pop up for you once again. This time, you are wiser and more experienced because you know the feeling of regret that came with that sense of loss, and you should also be far more prepared and determined. But don't jump in blindly as well. Gather as much information and help as you can to make the most of this. An opportunity at a distance may also come to you this month, and it may involve learning some new skill or some new area of interest. You might even consider a move to someplace else this month. The choice is yours of course, but it may be very appealing to you now to start fresh in a new place. You may feel like you are swimming in red tape with work, school or contract-related matter this month. But once you begin to untangle all of that red tape, you should find that it isn't nearly as complex as it seemed. You could be the recipient of many social invitations this month. You are always a welcome guest among your friends and colleagues. Your infectious enthusiasm is always appreciated, and you can be the life of the party when you are in the right mood. Your socializing could bring you an added bonus in December. You may connect with someone socially who can help you make a great deal of some kind. New Year's Eve plans should rank high on your agenda, so choose carefully how you are going to spend it.","interval":"2019m12","reqDate":"2019m12"}]}
