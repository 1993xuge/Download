Leonardo da Vinci most certainly did not paint this knowing it would become one of the most renowned and widely-known paintings of all time.

If you allow your heart to lead you, you will indeed create something memorable and impressive. You may be expecting a negative outcome to a conversation that might happen this week. But why harbor any preconceived notions? You may have reason to think negatively because of past dealings, but the past does not always predict the future.

The end of the week may bring unexpected news of a surprising nature or a thrilling opportunity.","interval":"2020w16","reqDate":"2020w16"}]}
