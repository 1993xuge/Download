{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"There could be an unexpected change this month that could be startling at first. This could be something that seems like - and actually is - an ending, but it could actually be the beginning of something else. This could mean a change in a relationship or a job. It could mean moving someplace out of necessity. It might mean that someone you count on will no longer seem close. But whatever it is, Scorpio, you can and will handle it, and if you hang in there, it will turn out for the best. This change could bring about an opportunity that you might never have anticipated, and it will be the reason for whatever happens. The hard work you did on behalf of someone else could pay off in a big way this month. This probably isn't something you would have expected, and so it will seem like a perk to a job well done that was taken on out of the goodness of your heart. This may be a great example of karma at work. A change in a plan this month will not be what you bargained for. In fact, you may feel that you got into a certain situation under false pretenses because someone did not tell you the whole story. But what's done is done, and you will need to make the best of it, or you could wind up feeling miserable. Let this remind you to ask more questions the next time a similar situation comes around. A fun and lucky invitation could come to you late in the month. Although it may be a few weeks hence, you will have time to plan on what to wear and to fantasize about how exciting it will be.","interval":"2020m02","reqDate":"2020m02"}]}
