{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may find yourself in a quiet or even a somber mood as the week begins, Scorpio, but as the week moves on, that mood will dramatically improve. You may get a phone call or a message that brings good news, and it will not only be a huge relief, but possibly also quite a surprise. And while you may begin the week feeling somewhat apathetic, as the vibe revs up, you should start to feel quite motivated and ambitious to get into your 2020 plans. There is quite a lot to be accomplished to reach the goals you have in mind, but you are up to the task. This week could be pivotal for you in that you may make a connection with someone who can either help you through guiding or teaching, or who can help you with financing or resources for your dreams. You may wish to dodge someone's questions this week, but you shouldn't feel like you are the one who should have to hide away. If someone is trying to intervene in something you are doing, or if they are trying to be pushy in getting you to do something in their way rather than yours, you can simply say no without having the need to run and hide. Stand up for yourself this week. An awkward encounter with someone you have been at odds with or estranged from could lead to a breakthrough in your relationship. Very positive things can come from this.","interval":"2020w03","reqDate":"2020w03"}]}
