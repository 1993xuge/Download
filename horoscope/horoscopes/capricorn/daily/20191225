{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You can be very hard on yourself, Capricorn. When you make even a small mistake, you might see it as a glaring mishap, while other people might not even notice it. And when you have a proud accomplishment, you tend to discard it. You need to work on making these tendencies go in the opposite direction. You need to start letting go of mistakes more easily, and start celebrating yourself and your accomplishments more. By reversing these tendencies, you will feel much happier, more fulfilled, and likely to have far more accomplishments in the future - and far fewer mistakes.","interval":"20191225","reqDate":"20191225"}]}
