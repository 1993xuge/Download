But because you move so quickly in your desire to get a lot done and to cover as much ground as possible, you sometimes miss details that can lead to a more complete picture of whatever you are trying to do. This week, you are encouraged to slow down, smell the roses, and take note of what is going on all around you. You may discover that you don't have to chase a certain goal all over the place because if you just start perfecting your talents in this area, the opportunities will come to you. You may be tempted to go off on an adventure this week that could involve a risky investment or some sort of gamble, but you are advised to reel in those emotions and to learn as much about this as you can. If you go in blindly, you may overlook a lot that could be important to you. Tread carefully and be smart about it. You may be working very hard to prove yourself to someone without realizing that you are already seen as a star and have nothing further to prove. This week, calm down with this and allow others to see your charming nature and your natural sense of humor. What can be a better way to show off your dazzling personality and your charm.","interval":"2019w48","reqDate":"2019w48"}]}
