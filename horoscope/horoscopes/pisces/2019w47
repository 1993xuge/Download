You may have faced at least one or two big challenges lately, and you may not be expecting anything to change. But change is coming and it's very positive. As you go about your week, keep this thought in mind and allow it to lighten your mood and give you hope and motivation. This is a great week for making low-risk investments, for discussing legal matters, and for making substantial purchases. Whatever you do in these areas will be bolstered by protection and positive energy. You may find yourself with a greater sense of initiative this week, which will enable you to take on a big project you had put off for a while. You should find that resources are more abundant and help is easier to find. Make the most of this period by covering as much ground as you can. With a tedious project you have been working on, you may need to keep reminding yourself that you are almost there. You have come so far, and recognizing just how close you are should motivate you to move even faster.","interval":"2019w47","reqDate":"2019w47"}]}
