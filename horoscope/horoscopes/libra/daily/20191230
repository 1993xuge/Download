{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Someone else's harsh or critical demeanor could imply that they don't approve of you, but you can't let that matter to you at all, Libra. Some people enjoy feeling superior by finding ways to criticize others or to offer negative opinions, but that is not your style. So, rather than reacting defensively or worrying if there is any validity in the behaviors you are experiencing from someone else, just assure yourself that you know what you are doing, and respond in a confident way. You will build up your own self-esteem this way.","interval":"20191230","reqDate":"20191230"}]}
