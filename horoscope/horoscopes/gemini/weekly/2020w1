You are usually known as quite friendly and often the life of the party, but many friends may appear in search of your camaraderie and your support this week, and it could turn into quite a party over the course of this week. Enjoy these times, for this is a great week to celebrate all your connections and friendships. You may receive interesting news from one special person. And praise from a higher-up at work or from someone you look up to will put a big grin on your face and a great deal of satisfaction in your heart. It will be reflective of a job well done, and the knowledge that you are so admired for will be quite amazing and fulfilling to you. Whether you are single or attached, romance could play a big role in your life this week. A special night out with the object of your affection could be on the agenda leading to a wonderful connection and new discoveries. There could be an awkward moment this week when someone asks for your involvement in a project you don't believe in. But don't hem and haw about it to save that person's feelings. Be sure to be clear about how you feel, or it could lead to a misunderstanding.","interval":"2020w01","reqDate":"2020w01"}]}
