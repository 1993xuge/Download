However, dwelling too much in the past and ruminating on past mistakes isn't good for you either. If you have become so caught up in an old mistake and a fear of failing at something again, it could hold you back from an upcoming opportunity. Don't dwell on past failure, Gemini. Nurture and encourage positivity and hope. Recognize that you are now wiser and able to start fresh with something you aspire to. You really can do it.","interval":"20200303","reqDate":"20200303"}]}
