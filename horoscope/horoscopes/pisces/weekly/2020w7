{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may have experienced a lot of change in recent months, Pisces. This week, you may find yourself reflecting on all that you have gone through and evaluating whether it has been mostly good and where you can go from here. It is critical not to push yourself to come to any conclusions too quickly. Take your time and be kind to yourself as you figure out how these changes evolved, what they mean, and how they can help you live the fullest life possible. This is all good as long as you choose to perceive it in that way. You may find yourself doubting your own talents or abilities as you take on a new role at work or among a group this week. You are insecure at times, mostly because you are so humble and sensitive. But you have enormous talents that you underplay, and you need to focus a bit this week on how truly great you are at certain things. We all have different strengths and natural abilities, and you are richly blessed in this way. Work on building your confidence and believing more in yourself. Your love life may get a boost this week. If you are attached, you may find that your partner is feeling especially romantic, and they may want to spend a quiet evening together bonding more closely and reigniting the spark. If you are single, this is a great time to get out and about and meet new people. Although you may not meet \"the one\" immediately, you can start thinking about what you need and what you should look for in a special someone.","interval":"2020w07","reqDate":"2020w07"}]}
