{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"As the pressure mounts around work or possibly your home life this week, you may have a growing desire to just get away from it all. That may not be possible right now, Taurus, but you can at least spend some time fantasizing about doing just that once things settle down a bit, which should begin to happen towards the end of the week. Pick up some travel brochures or do some research online to discover places you would like to go, and let that be your \"happy place\" as you accomplish your tasks and goals for the week. A big issue related to a major purchase or a money matter may come to a boiling point, and it may seem like too much to pile onto your already full plate of things to deal with. But you should find that resolving this can happen quickly if you don't let it stress you out. Be patient. You may garner some positive attention or even an opportunity because of the work you are doing in an area of your life that is special to you, and this could be great news indeed. This should make up completely for some of the difficult stuff you have endured recently and will energize you and propel you forward, feeling good about yourself and feeling satisfied to be recognized. Hang in there, because you can accomplish quite a lot this week if you don't get frazzled.","interval":"2020w04","reqDate":"2020w04"}]}
