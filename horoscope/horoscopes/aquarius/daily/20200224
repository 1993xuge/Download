It can be a great shield and can offer cathartic release when you need it most by deflecting the negative. But with humor, you must also be careful that it is properly timed and tasteful considering the situation.

But it is certainly okay to think funny without saying it out loud.","interval":"20200224","reqDate":"20200224"}]}
