{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may find yourself reevaluating your career or some other major aspect of your life this month, Capricorn. But this is a good thing, and it should be an enjoyable learning experience. You could very well wind up realizing that where you already are is where you really want to be, but what you learn in the process could become quite valuable in part because it validates your earlier choices. A seminar or a class could be required for you this month most likely related to work, but it could feel more like fun than work, so don't give in to any negative misperceptions or expectations. You may have to work through a personal issue to take advantage of an offer or an opportunity that comes to you through a friend or co-worker. This may be something you should get over anyway, and this will be an excellent chance to feel inspired to take on the challenge. The confidence that you build through this experience could benefit you in many areas of your life now and in the future. An illusion you have had about a loved one may come falling apart in December. And although this will require you to adjust the way you deal with this person; this is actually a good thing. Getting reacquainted with this person in a more honest way will bring your connection down to earth and will enable better bonding and communication.","interval":"2019m12","reqDate":"2019m12"}]}
