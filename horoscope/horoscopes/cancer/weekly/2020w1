{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Excellent news on the financial front or with some project that has the potential to be a money-maker may come to you this month, Moonchild. This has been a long time coming, and you may have begun to wonder if it would ever happen. So, be sure to take some time to celebrate this week, because you need to acknowledge how worthy you are of this. Good and important news that may come to you during the week will have a family connection to it. You may have to make a decision this week that involves someone else, but ultimately, you may defer to that person to make the choice. You may feel it is not as much about you as it is about the other party, but letting go of the reins here could be a mistake. You need to weigh in and at least express how you feel and give your opinions, for you may be far more objective about this. Prosperity and abundance are increasing for you now, and this week you may begin to see signs of its imminent arrival, even if nothing concrete happens. This will give you a reason for hope and will uplift your emotions. In the beginning of the week, take a moment on New Year's Eve to toast yourself and your future.","interval":"2020w01","reqDate":"2020w01"}]}
