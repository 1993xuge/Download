{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"This week, Sagittarius, you could receive an invitation for something that will occur at some point in the far-off future. Right now, you may have trouble thinking about the next day, let alone the next week or month. But if you say yes, it will give you something positive to plan for and to look forward to, and that may be exactly what you need right now. You have approached a certain assignment in a very mature and responsible way. Perhaps you have taken a very traditional, conservative approach. But what may be needed most this week is more of a childlike approach to this matter. If you let go of old-fashioned ideas and embrace a more dynamic creative approach, you may come up with something that will shake up the status quo and add some excitement to your reputation. A well-planned endeavor that didn't turn out all that well may come around again for a second chance this week. This time take it more slowly and more cautiously. There is no need to rush. If you choose to see this as a learning experience, it will benefit you tremendously.","interval":"2020w14","reqDate":"2020w14"}]}
