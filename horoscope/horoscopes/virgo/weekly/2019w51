{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"After a recent letdown, Virgo, it may be hard to pull yourself up by your bootstraps and get back to work but you must. This week is filled with some wonderful possibilities that will require you to be out and about and be receptive to new ideas and exciting opportunities. Socializing this week could lead to meeting people who can connect you with some opportunities, and this is also a great time to meet people with whom you feel closeness of ideas and who share your dreams and have the ability to inspire you. You should sail through a difficult work challenge this week with the help of a mentor or older person who can teach and guide you. Your hard work way back when may finally begin to show signs of paying you back this week or very soon. This may give you the chance to reflect on that effort and take pride in what you accomplished. You may have a long-term goal that you have put off again and again because you knew that it would not pay off soon enough, but this is something you can deal with casually and enjoy the process. So what is there to lose? This could bring you a big reward with very little effort. Be aware of your spending habits this week because you may want to start saving for a purchase that could make your life easier and happier.","interval":"2019w51","reqDate":"2019w51"}]}
