You compete with yourself all the time, always trying to better your last effort. But you may not like the idea of going against another person in the same way. An upcoming opportunity, though, may require a bit of competition with someone else. However, you can still look at it as competing with your last best effort. You can easily rise to the occasion and ascend beyond your former performance. Go for it.","interval":"20191216","reqDate":"20191216"}]}
