{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Money isn't everything. It can't replace happy moments with friends or the love and care of family. But when there is either a shortage of it or you focus on having greater financial security in your life, it may seem like everything. If your financial situation is on your mind for any reason right now, Aries, you need to know that your monetary forecast is looking good, and the improvement and positive changes may begin to occur this week. This could happen in many different ways, such as a chance to earn more through your work, the possibility of cashing in an investment, an unexpected windfall, and so on. Just be as judicious as possible in how you decide to handle any good fortune that comes your way. Good fortune could come to you in other ways this week as well. You may receive good news that something you applied for or asked for will be coming to you. Although this may not be a sure thing, it appears very favorable as long as you reply or respond in whatever way is necessary. A lack of respect may be a problem with an authority figure this week for either you or someone in your life, but you will likely be involved no matter who this impacts. Before you vent or say anything too critical, you need to consider that sometimes this type of behavior comes from personal insecurity, and responding in a harsh way will put someone on the defensive and maybe make things even worse. The end of the week brings great hope for a new venture in your life.","interval":"2020w07","reqDate":"2020w07"}]}
