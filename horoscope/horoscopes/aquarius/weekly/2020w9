{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You can begin this week with a clean slate where a relationship matter is concerned, Aquarius. Don't be stubborn or resentful. You must know that clearing this matter up will bring you joy and help guide an important connection back to where it should be. Do the smart thing. Be careful this week about investing too much energy in a project that you believe could fail easily. You may be trying to prove a point, but at what cost? If you get into this over your head, there could be emotional and perhaps financial costs that you are not thinking about now. This time could be quite busy for you, and you may feel overwhelmed from the outset just wondering how you will get everything done that needs to be done. But if you prioritize carefully and delegate wisely, you will be able to handle all of this and then some. Don't be afraid to take charge. An old grudge may have been keeping you away from someone whose company you have always enjoyed. Whether the grudge is being held by you or by the other party, this is a powerful week to extend or accept the olive branch. You can work this out and move beyond it if you have the desire to do so. Be more mindful of a choice you have that you aren't taking as seriously as you should. This could involve your home or your work, and there are options available to you now that could be quite good for you if you are ready to make a move.","interval":"2020w09","reqDate":"2020w09"}]}
