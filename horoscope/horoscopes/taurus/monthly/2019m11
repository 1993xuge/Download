{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"The focus for you this month, dear Taurus, needs to be on your own well-being. And that doesn't just mean making sure that things are going well in specific areas of your life. This is about your entire well-being and recognizing what may be wrong, what is right, and what you can do to put yourself in the best place possible in all areas of your life. This means paying attention to how well you eat, the quality and duration of your sleep, the relationships in your life, the work you are doing, the dreams you are striving for - or not striving for but should be - and so on. There are forces at work on your behalf now that will assist you if you put in your share of the effort. A new role at work or in some organization or situation that involves other people may come up for you this month. While you may not think this is a good fit for you at first, if you at least give it a try, you may find that it fits you better than you imagined and may even be quite positive and enjoyable. A change in a relationship may cause you some concern this month, but if you explore what is happening, you may just find that the change has nothing to do with you personally, and that there may be a way for you to help your loved one rise out of a difficult situation. November is a good month in which to celebrate your relationships and to recognize how important they are to you by spending quality time nurturing them with your loved ones.","interval":"2019m11","reqDate":"2019m11"}]}
