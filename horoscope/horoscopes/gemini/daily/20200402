{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Homo sapiens' edge was always the deep integration of social structure. Indisputably we are inherently social beings. We like spending time in the company of others we like and people that stimulate our thoughts - especially someone like you, Gemini. When we can't spend time around those we care about, we can become bored or depressed. Some other social animals like dogs, for example, might start chewing the furniture, and similarly, a bored person might do something that's not all that healthy, such as eating too many sweets or falling into patterns of negative thinking. That's why it takes a special kind of nurturing to get through a period of time alone, if that's what you're experiencing now, Gemini. Find ways to communicate and find good outlets for your energy, and you will come out feeling much better.","interval":"20200402","reqDate":"20200402"}]}
