If so, Aries, this could be a way of keeping the power to themselves. But you have the ability to self-learn just as anyone else does. Although it would be nice to have a mentor or a teacher, you may have to do your own research and learn at your own pace. This could actually be better eventually because this is a better way to gain your own personal insights and ways of doing things. And that's not something to be stressing about.","interval":"20200319","reqDate":"20200319"}]}
