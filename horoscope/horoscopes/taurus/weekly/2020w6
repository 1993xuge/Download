{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"There may be a lot of focus this week on your significant other if you have one, or someone you see as a partner in some way. That means this could also be someone you are doing business with or in \"cahoots\" with in some other way. This can be a pleasant experience, except that you may have to overcome a hurdle or two in your relationship that has existed for quite some time. This may be an issue that you have been putting off, dear Taurus, but dealing with it now is important, for it will allow you to move ahead to more exciting endeavors with this person with a sense of clarity and peace. A delay or a change of plans could feel like it has the potential to derail a project that is important to you this week, but it can't unless you allow that to happen. If you choose to see this as a simple challenge, you will find it to be a great test of your strength, endurance, and diplomatic skills, but you can do it. Rather than going back to the drawing board with a project that you see as a failure, you may want to sort it out in some other way. There may be some adjustments you can make that will make this go far smoother, adjustments that will also bring you greater satisfaction. In other words, don't let a few small problems cause you to trash what you have worked so hard to accomplish.","interval":"2020w06","reqDate":"2020w06"}]}
