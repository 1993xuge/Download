While you may not feel like the expert that others see in you, dear Moonchild, you should take pride in the fact that you are so highly thought of. Don't waste time feeling insecure and underestimating what you are capable of. Just do your best, and you will prove to everyone - especially yourself - that you are stellar and blessed with an abundance of talent. Let that sink in. There may be a matter related to real estate or home that comes up this week, much to your relief and joy. Something you have been hoping to accomplish is getting closer and closer, and you are starting to see tangible signs that this is going to happen. Don't waste your energy worrying or speculating; just allow this to unfold as though you were just an observer. A matter related to your romantic life may arise this week. This may be about an existing relationship that seems to be getting better and better and where it should go from here. Or you may meet someone new, and you might be considering starting something - and if so, that would be a very good idea.","interval":"2020w17","reqDate":"2020w17"}]}
