Most of us understand this adage, but there are people out there who will criticize others when they have glaring faults themselves. If someone has criticized you recently, Capricorn, be the better person and take the high road. Although there may be many ways you could come up with to criticize this individual back, doing so would only make you feel smaller and drag you into something you really don't want to be dragged into. Resist the urge, and enjoy the view from the higher moral ground.","interval":"20200409","reqDate":"20200409"}]}
