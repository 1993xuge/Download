{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Even though you may not see yourself as the ideal mediator, Virgo, this week you may have the chance to help others see the good in each other and be able to work together in some way. Although you are loved for your gentle spirit, your courtesy, and your dignity, you may not feel at home when trying to lead or show others how to read from the same page. But if you go with your intuition, you will know exactly what to say to make that happen. An unwanted task or a favor someone asks of you this week may be the last thing you would want to do. However, if you grin and bear it and make the best of it, you could find this to be a stepping stone to something that you really do want. Don't say no because it seems boring or dreary. Tending a garden requires consistent attention and care. You have to pay attention to the weather. You have to be sure your plants are watered and fertilized. You have to prune and dig and so on. The same goes for relationships. If one of yours is \"wilting\" now, this is a good time to start nurturing it again. It is not too late to save this and transform it into something beautiful and thriving once again. The end of the week could see a quickening pace in your life with some new venture to get involved in. Just be sure to tie up old business before you get started.","interval":"2020w10","reqDate":"2020w10"}]}
