{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"If you are true to yourself and to your values this month, Aquarius, you will be true to your higher, truer self. This will be extremely important when an important window of opportunity opens briefly. You may be offered less than you want, but when you recognize your own value and you honor it, this will work out to your greatest advantage. You may never have fully gotten over a loss you suffered quite a long time ago - perhaps many, many years ago - but the chance to better understand and heal from this could begin to happen this month. This could erase years of bad feelings that have accumulated, and may come through a message you pick up in some simple yet extraordinary way. You may find yourself at a crossroads with your job or with a personal endeavor this month. This turning point will be very clear, and you may have to make a decision to go down one road or another. You have been gathering information on this for some time, and you have everything you need to make the best choice - so don't be afraid to go with your heart. It won't lead you astray. And once you set foot on that new path, it will just feel right, validating what you chose to do. You can break a destructive pattern this month when a recurring issue occurs again with a friend. This time, do what you have wanted to do but have been afraid to do, and you can set a brand new and much better precedent.","interval":"2019m11","reqDate":"2019m11"}]}
