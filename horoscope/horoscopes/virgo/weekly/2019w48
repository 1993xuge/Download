{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may find yourself celebrating a small victory this week - perhaps with a team effort - that is meaningful to you on so many levels, dear Virgo. Be sure to acknowledge and recognize that what you have achieved is well-deserved. Even if this is just a small happening, it is important to you, and it could connect you to bigger things down the road. You may be having doubts this week about a plan that you have already set in motion. But before you give up prematurely, you need to question if this is based on facts or based on fears. You may be afraid of failing or of being disappointed, but what is unlikely to happen. The stars are encouraging you to keep going and to do your best to recognize the great value in this. A heart-to-heart talk may be called for this week when an issue you have been avoiding comes up in conversation, or when someone confronts you about it. Don't run away from this because settling it will bring you a great deal of peace, and it will allow you to ease into harmony with a relationship that has been challenging. This could be the beginning of a whole new phase with someone special.","interval":"2019w48","reqDate":"2019w48"}]}
