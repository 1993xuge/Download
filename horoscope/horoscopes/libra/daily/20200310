A map might help if you have one. You could call a friend who is familiar with the area. Or you could ask for directions. But what if you found yourself without those options? You will probably keep traveling until you get back to an area with a signal. You may have been doing very well on a new venture, Libra, only to lose your way suddenly. Researching or asking for assistance may help, of course. But you can also continue to explore the possibilities until the right direction becomes clear to you. Don't stress and worry. You will find a way eventually.","interval":"20200310","reqDate":"20200310"}]}
