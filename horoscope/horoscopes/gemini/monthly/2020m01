{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"So, Gemini, what's in your big bag of tricks for the month of January? Wait a minute - you may be wondering why that question is being asked of you since you came here to hear all about how your month would go. But no, the main thing you have to keep in mind this month is that this is your ship, and you are the captain at the steering wheel. Luck and abundance are in store for you now, and this can be a month filled with abundance in many areas of your life - if you choose to create a strong plan, keep dreaming, and believe in yourself. Although you may experience a rough spot or two at the beginning of the month - perhaps resulting from old business that may not have been completely tied up - you can start moving forward with your plans very quickly once you wrap that up. Your plans may include efforts to check a few items off your bucket list or explore some exciting travel plans for the year ahead. But it can't be all play and no work, so you will also want to do some thinking about your career or your income stream, as you may want to make some moves in those areas of your life. But even that can be fun if you surround yourself with intelligent, inspirational people and remain optimistic. Yes, this can be both a very productive and a very happy month for you - but it will benefit you greatly to concentrate on one matter at a time, rather than scattering your thoughts and your energy in many directions at once.","interval":"2020m01","reqDate":"2020m01"}]}
