{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Boredom is not an inescapable sentence. No one can force you to be bored. It can be relieved by challenging yourself to do something you have never done before - even if it is simply learning something that intimidates you, writing a letter to someone that you never had the nerve to write to before, or something else that inspires you or pushes you outside of your usual area of comfort. If you are feeling bored or mired in the same routine now, Aquarius, find a way to challenge yourself. It can be a great opportunity to try something new or learn something valuable.","interval":"20200327","reqDate":"20200327"}]}
