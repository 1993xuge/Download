{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may find yourself feeling pressured to perform at an extraordinarily high level in some new endeavor or partnership. Since you are always someone who puts your best foot forward, Taurus, you need not worry. You may be imposing this pressure on yourself and projecting it onto others. Just relax and do your best, and that will be reflected in what others see in you. Trying to remain upbeat will be your best defense for any worries you may have. Do not allow feelings of stress or pressure to cause you to mistrust your intuitive vibes this week, for they are especially strong right now. If you have a strong gut feeling about something, then pay attention to it. Meditation, as well as other activities that bring you peace and comfort, may be especially helpful to you this week if you do find concerns weighing you down. For example, if you are someone who likes to bake, doing that or any other comforting activity can help keep you in a peaceful and more relaxed mindset. Always remember that you are in charge of how you feel.","interval":"2020w15","reqDate":"2020w15"}]}
