{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may discover this week that you share a goal with someone you admire. This discovery could lead to discussions about teaming up to plan and launch this goal together. Just be sure that absolutely every aspect of this is understood, though, or it could lead to trouble in paradise. As long as you each clearly understand the other's wants and needs, Taurus, this could be a very successful partnership. Unasked for advice could come to you this week from someone who irritates you. And this person irritates you primarily because they are often offering unsolicited advice! Seems like you need to break a pattern so that this does not continue. If this occurs, be sure to use this opportunity to voice how you feel about this. Information may come to you this week that seems to be authoritative, and it may be connected to a financial aspect of your life. This could involve an investment, a legal matter that is connected to money, a large purchase, or really anything else. But don't trust what you hear. Be sure to validate that it comes from a trusted source, that it is reliable information, and find out what you must do to implement it. You could receive a compliment this week from someone you had no idea admired you so much. Allow yourself to not only believe and accept this but to recognize that you are appreciated even during those times when it doesn't seem that way.","interval":"2019w50","reqDate":"2019w50"}]}
