{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Well, it's almost here, Aries - the end of the year and the beginning of a brand-new year. That's a blank canvas on which you can paint absolutely anything you want. And there is a lot that you would want this coming year. This week, even though it isn't yet officially 2020, you can start making plans and fantasizing about what you want and how you will go about getting it. You may find yourself feeling especially inspired and enthused this week with brilliant ideas for fulfilling your plans hitting you like lightning strikes. This is the time to start making it all happen. If you have plans for the big night, there may be a small twist coming this week that could surprise you. Someone you had not expected to see may come into the picture, which could make the celebrations even more exciting. You may also learn something that will come as good news, and perhaps see a related scenario come full circle. A big and complicated legal matter or an issue that involved negotiations may come up this week as well, and at first it may seem unsolvable. But something you hear or overhear could give you an idea that could lead to a successful conclusion. Just think twice before saying anything to be sure you express yourself clearly and fully.","interval":"2020w01","reqDate":"2020w01"}]}
