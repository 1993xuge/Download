When Dog used to have nine tails he snuck into Heaven to steal grain for humanity, but the guards of heaven chopped off eight of his tails as he was escaping. Dog carried the grain back to Earth stuck on his remaining tail — and that is why stalks of grain look like a dog’s tail.","Those born in the year of the Dog are loyal and brave with an innate sense of duty. They may not seek leadership positions, but they often end up chosen as leaders due to their impartial sense of justice, intelligence, diplomacy, and determination to fight for what they know is right.","Dogs are known to have a heightened ability to immediately discern the underlying motives of both people and situations, and may be sharp tempered when others lack their high moral ground. Dogs are possibly the least materialistic of the signs, and are not driven by money, although they are adept at earning whatever they need.","Dogs are animated, likable, witty, sincere, direct, cooperative, protective, helpful, and generous.  They are often introverts. Dogs are extremely faithful and supportive to friends and family. They can be huge worriers and should beware of becoming pessimistic, cynical, paranoid, overly aggressive, stubborn, cold, overly critical, or self-sacrificing."]},"success":true}
