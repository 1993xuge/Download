So, Gemini, who should you listen to? The healthiest, wisest thing you can do in a time of fear or crisis is to turn to the light and remain hopeful believing that the best will be. Anything less is not productive or positive. You have the power to contribute to a beautiful, benevolent vibration that can go out into the world and uplift whomever it reaches. Be a voice of calm and reason - someone who others can rely on for their strength. Today you shall have that extra strength you will need for that.","interval":"20200322","reqDate":"20200322"}]}
