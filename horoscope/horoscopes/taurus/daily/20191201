{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Being empathic and compassionate are very admirable traits. We should all treat others the way we wish to be treated. But when you are overly empathic and compassionate to the point where you make excuses for someone, your response can become unrealistic, and you can set yourself up to be taken advantage of. Someone new in your life may offer quite a sob story, and you may feel compelled to help. Just be sure what you see is genuine rather than emotional manipulation. If you wish to help someone, Taurus, save your energy for a genuine need.","interval":"20191201","reqDate":"20191201"}]}
