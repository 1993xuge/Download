That's because you can be very solitary, independent, strong-minded, and you do like to do things in your own unique way. However, you are not an island, and even though you are often a shell-dweller, seeking out and enjoying social interactions is important - even for you. This week take some time to step out and meet and greet your favorite people, as well as welcoming some new and interesting characters into your life. You need that right now. Home is always where the heart is for people of your sign, but lately, there has been some upset or unease around your home life. It may be that you are unhappy about where you are living, or there is something about your home - or someone who lives there - and that is what's troubling you. But that may be easily resolvable if you set your mind to it. And you do have a wilful and sharp mind, so get started and don't stop until you bring things back to peace and harmony again. A decision you settled on recently may be coming up again. There may have been something you did not think through, and it will suddenly occur to you this week. Don't be afraid to backtrack. It may just be a simple change that won't require too much aggravation, and it will give you great comfort knowing that your choice was perfect.","interval":"2020w10","reqDate":"2020w10"}]}
