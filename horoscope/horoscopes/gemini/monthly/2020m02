{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Have you been wishing for good luck, good fortune, abundance, and more as it relates to a certain matter that keeps dragging on? You may feel like the requests you have sent out to the universe have been ignored, Gemini, but this month you may see the smaller blocks to what you are wishing for fall away, giving you easier access to what you are reaching for. But keep in mind that no one is going to hand you what you want on a silver platter. You will have to be dedicated and vigilant to make this happen. So, remain alert and aware throughout February, and you should see several possibilities open up to you. That would be the answer to your requests. You may have had the urge to make a luxury purchase, and this may be on your mind now. But there could be a few expenses that come up in February that would require you to wait. What you need to spend money on, though, will be toward things that make your life better, which will eventually lead to greater financial security. Your home and your family may be a primary point of focus for you this month. There may be a matter that involves multiple family members, and you could wind up contributing some great ideas on how to resolve it. Just be sure that everyone is heard, and this will work out just fine. A change of scenery late in the month could bring you the serenity and internal harmony you have been striving for.","interval":"2020m02","reqDate":"2020m02"}]}
