{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"This week, Scorpio, you may find yourself contemplating making a break from a group you belong to. Whether this is a professional group, a group of friends, or even a club you belong to, the tone of the group may have changed in a way that does not appeal to you any longer. Don't feel bad about it, but try to find something else to replace it - and that could be a productive and enjoyable use of your time. Someone you meet this week could make a really strong impression on you in a positive way. This could be someone you admire related to your career, or it could be someone who has achieved something you have been hoping to achieve yourself. Don't be shy in reaching out to this individual, for you may find this person very receptive to serving as a helpful source and possibly a mentor. You tend to keep a lot inside, and this would be a great time to find some way of expressing yourself that allows you to vent. You may be going through a tough time in a relationship, and since you may not want to reveal your deeper thoughts and feelings, finding an outlet for it could be very healthy. Whether this is done through writing in a journal, talking out loud about the matter while alone, or in any other way, it can help you figure out what steps to take next. You may get a lot of attention and flattery from someone this week, but be sure you respond clearly and honestly - so as not to wind up with a misunderstanding.","interval":"2020w06","reqDate":"2020w06"}]}
