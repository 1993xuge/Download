{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You are a big and impressive cat, Leo, and you invariably land on your feet. When you do experience a blunder, it is usually because you have had a temporary lapse of confidence, which is fairly rare. This month, you may be facing something new - something that you have been inclined to worry about. But if you begin immediately, you can take control of your emotions, erase the fear, and take charge of what you are doing. You have it in you to be a leader and a success story, and what you accomplish this month can be quite impressive and can serve you for a long time into the future. So, get control right away. If you have a favorite restaurant, then you might also have a favorite chair in that restaurant. And then, if you have to sit elsewhere one time because your favorite spot is already taken when you arrive, it may not feel like the same experience. We are creatures of habit, and we get used to enjoying things in a certain set way. While this does offer a great sense of comfort, it can also be limiting. This month, something you are used to may be a bit different than usual. Instead of regretting that it did not work out in the expected way, try to embrace the new experience. That does not mean that things will never be the same; it just shows that you can adapt and thrive wherever you land and whatever the circumstances are.","interval":"2020m04","reqDate":"2020m04"}]}
