{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Your sense of overall security should begin to become far more enhanced this month, Libra. This could be either financially, in your relationships, in your living situation in general, or all of the above. Whatever has been most on your mind should become easier and more harmonious in the weeks ahead. This, in turn, will bring confidence to all areas of your life giving you the boost of inspiration you need to pursue some of the dreams you may have set aside because you felt some instability in your life. A family matter may arise this month that you will not want to deal with, even though others may see you as the perfect person to set things straight. But if your gut feeling is telling you to steer clear of this mess, then, by all means, do so no matter how much someone implores you to do otherwise. If you go against your instincts, you may wind up with trouble you don't need and don't have to have. A deeper connection - even a sense of a kindred, soulmate kind of a connection - is possible with someone that you have been at odds with. This may seem impossible with the person you have in mind, but it can truly be a reality if you follow your heart. Someone who is at the center of a misunderstanding may come to you for clarification later in the month, shedding light on how and why the confusion began. Don't be stubborn, be receptive instead. Do what you can to meet this person halfway, and you can set yourself free from this irritating situation in no time.","interval":"2019m11","reqDate":"2019m11"}]}
