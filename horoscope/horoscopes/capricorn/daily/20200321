{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"\"Help! Help! The sky is falling.\" That quotation is from \"Chicken Little,\" a folk tale about a chicken who believes the world is coming to an end. And in the end of the story, of course, the world does not end. The moral of this tale is not to believe everything you hear, to be courageous, and not to panic. We all have moments in our lives when it seems like the world is about to end to varying degrees. But no matter what the problem may be, handling it in a cool, calm, and non-panicked way is the best way to ensure a happy ending. If that happens today and you feel panicked, all you need to do is find your center and your strength, and any panic of impending trouble will subside.","interval":"20200321","reqDate":"20200321"}]}
