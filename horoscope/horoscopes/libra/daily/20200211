You may be offended that someone is not thinking about how you are affected by something they are saying or doing. But before you react, you need to consider that this may be unintentional. There may be no awareness that anything is wrong, and if you assume that it is intentional - well, that's how a conflict can start. So, begin by voicing how you feel calmly and respectfully, and you can most likely resolve this without escalation.","interval":"20200211","reqDate":"20200211"}]}
