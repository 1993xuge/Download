{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Many people get upset at times at the little irritating things that happen in life. For example, if we order something at the diner and the waiter gets our order wrong, we might become overly bothered by it, especially if we had certain expectations or something else went wrong. But this certainly isn't a dire matter. We often overreact to things in life that have little importance, even when there are other things we could be doing that would be far more rewarding and productive. This week, Moonchild, you may experience a block or a delay in something you are doing - but if you analyze it, you will realize that it isn't really all that important in the big scheme of things. Don't take it too seriously. Just go on out and find something more worthy of your energy and your time, and you will fulfill yourself on many levels. An older relative or someone who cannot get out as much as they used to may be longing to see your face. If you have not had the time recently to visit, make a point this week of stopping by or calling your loved ones. You may have no idea how much your smile or the sound of your voice means to that person or persons, and they can likewise lift your spirits too. You may find yourself in the company of a rampant complainer this week, and this person could easily drag your mood down with them. But if you remain aware of that possibility, make a conscious effort instead to be buoyant in your thoughts, and you will lift your own spirit and inspire others to feel happier as well.","interval":"2020w05","reqDate":"2020w05"}]}
