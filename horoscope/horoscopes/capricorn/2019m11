{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may have a lot on your mind related to a personal relationship early in the month. This may be something that has been ongoing for quite some time, Capricorn. But you may be overreacting to something someone said based on your perception of their behavior. Keep in mind that stress can lead you to feel unsure of yourself and to interpret things differently. If this worry continues, go to the source and just ask, because it is likely that you have nothing to worry about. Your forecast in relationships is excellent right now, but understanding yourself and your own reactions is essential to your well-being. There could be major growth in several important areas of your life this month. One of the most outstanding could be your sense of confidence and self-esteem. Recent events have helped build you up to feel surer of yourself, and that trend is set to continue. You should also see some excellent evolution in your financial life. There may be opportunities on the horizon that are not going to unfold imminently, but just knowing that they exist should give you a much greater sense of security. An old feeling of abandonment or rejection, perhaps from very long ago, may finally be put into perspective, and you will feel better about how you are handling it. Toward the end of the month, there may be much more to a story than meets the eye. Someone may be telling you the truth, but not the whole truth. Stay tuned for more to come, and you may hear an amazing conclusion if you are patient and you don't push.","interval":"2019m11","reqDate":"2019m11"}]}
