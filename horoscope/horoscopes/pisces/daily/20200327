{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Drama often follows you, Pisces. You have a flair for the unique and exciting, and you just naturally stir up emotions and excitement all around you. And sometimes, you can't even help it when dramatic moments arise. But keep in mind that not everyone can handle all that drama and excitement. Does that mean that you should tone it down around certain people? Or should you just be yourself? Sometimes you tend to hide your light when you feel unaccepted or out of your element, but that doesn't change who you are. Be proud of your depth and your differences, and allow yourself to shine.","interval":"20200327","reqDate":"20200327"}]}
