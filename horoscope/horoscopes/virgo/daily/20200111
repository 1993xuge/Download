{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"If your car were to break down or get a flat tire, you might want to fix it immediately, especially if you are heavily reliant on it for your daily travels. You would know that repairing your car would take some time and will probably cost you, but you would do it anyway because you'd have no other choice. You may have a problem now that you keep pushing aside because of the inconvenience or the associated cost, but dealing with it quickly will get you past the issue quickly as well - and then you can resume a comfortable pace. Take care of business today, Virgo, and set your mind at ease.","interval":"20200111","reqDate":"20200111"}]}
