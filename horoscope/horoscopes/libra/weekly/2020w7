{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"This week, Libra, you may find yourself in extra need of a little bit of nurturing. If there isn't anyone in your life who pampers you, then you can certainly do some nice things for yourself, and you should. Whether this means a special purchase of something that you have been wanting, a visit to a friend you have been wanting to spend time with, a hot bath with scented oils, or absolutely anything else - you need to do something for yourself that will make you feel warm and happy. Not only do you need it, but you also deserve it. You may be feeling a bit more emotional than usual this week too. That's why it will be important to spend more time with people who make you smile, and surround yourself with things that you find inspirational, things that lift your spirit. Doing so will make you feel happier, more optimistic, and ready for anything. A group outing could occur this week, and an invitation to tag along could come to you later in the week. Even if you have a busy schedule, it is important to spend time with your favorite social group, so say yes if you can. A conversation with a friend or even a stranger could lead you to thoughts of what you are doing with your life and if there is some purpose you are overlooking. To satisfy this idea, you need to take it seriously and start exploring interests that you have left by the wayside. You may have a special reason to start something new that will be very fulfilling.","interval":"2020w07","reqDate":"2020w07"}]}
