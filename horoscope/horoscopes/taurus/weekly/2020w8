{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"A great sense of relief may wash over you this week like a warm wave washing over you on the shoreline of a beautiful ocean landscape. The source of this? An answer that comes to you this week may dispel all the fears you had about an important relationship or some other unfinished business with someone who is important to you in some other way. When this arrives, though, be thoughtful about it and ponder what you can learn from it and what you can take away to apply to your life in the future. An overheard conversation, or something that comes to you in the form of chit-chat or gossip could be upsetting, but it is not likely to be true or fully true. Before you start worrying about something that hasn't even happened, dear Taurus, fact-check what you have heard, and you should be able to put your mind at ease. Don't count your chickens before they've hatched is a philosophy you believe in, but this week you may find yourself adding up all of the gains you can make from a prospective opportunity. However, adhere to that adage before you start building this up in your mind, as the reality may not reflect the fantasy. This does not mean, though, that it can't be a good thing in some way. You may want to turn to a trusted friend or family member to give you feedback on a dilemma or a decision that you are facing. This person can help you see things more objectively.","interval":"2020w08","reqDate":"2020w08"}]}
