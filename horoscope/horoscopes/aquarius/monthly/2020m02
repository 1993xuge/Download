{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may have to make a change to a big project this month based on someone else's direction. You may think that things are if not absolutely perfect then pretty good as they are, Aquarius, but you may not have any choice in the matter. You should speak up even so because then your thoughts and ideas will be a matter of record. You may eventually get to return to your original idea and do it your way, but this will have to follow a certain process before it gets to that point. You may experience someone's jealousy over your achievements this month. Don't take it too personally though. When someone is insecure, they begin to resent others for what they wish they had. If this is a friend, just be as encouraging and flattering as you can be in an authentic way, and help them work through their feelings of envy. That might not be the advice you would get from an outside observer, but good energy will prevail if you give back good energy even when you receive negativity. You could experience a truly golden few days this month when something you want most in the world comes closer to you. The possibilities and the way to approach this may seem endless and that could be very confusing, but if you trust in your intuition and head toward your true north, you will know exactly what to do. Make the most of this chance. You will need to nip an argument in the bud before the end of the month, or it could escalate into something ugly. By redirecting some unkind comments, you can turn things around dramatically.","interval":"2020m02","reqDate":"2020m02"}]}
