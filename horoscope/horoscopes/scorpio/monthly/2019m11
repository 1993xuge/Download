{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Communication should be heightened for you this month, Scorpio. This will not only be about finding it easier to understand others and others being more able to understand you - but it could mean that you will find yourself communicating more freely in general. This is something that sometimes troubles you, as you do have an issue with revealing your deepest feelings. But some twist of fate that occurs could open your heart and let the sunshine in, making you feel uplifted in this way. A storm of attention could come to you at work or in some area of your life that displays your talents. While this may seem like an intrusion at first, you should quickly come to recognize how truly beneficial this could be for you. Make the most of this period while it lasts, because it could mean success in a significant endeavor. Someone could work hard at trying to persuade you to join into a venture or investment that you have doubts about. While this person's presentation may be quite enticing, this month is not the best one for you to become engaged in risky ventures. Be extra careful and don't rely solely on what you hear. Do your own investigating to be sure that everything is as it seems. A matter connected to your home life may come up this month but should be positive news. This could mean anything from finding out that a house you want to purchase will be yours, or that a living situation with someone you love is about to change in a very positive way.","interval":"2019m11","reqDate":"2019m11"}]}
