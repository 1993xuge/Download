{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"If you have been considering a residential move, Virgo, this is a great week to start exploring - but it is not the best time to make that big decision. Take your time and enjoy the process of looking and learning, but set aside specific expectations, because you may discover that you really want something beyond what you think you want. You may have some concern for a close friend or family member. This may be due to an emotionally charged matter. But you can help this person immensely if you just take the time to listen, offer encouragement, and just be there. You may think about entering into some type of an agreement this week, which could be anything from a job to a big purchase. Luck is with you on this, and whatever you decide will be blessed. Keep in mind - especially toward the end of the month - that not all that glitters is gold. There may be some seemingly promising opportunity afoot, but it could turn out not to be all it's cracked up to be. Something better may come along soon afterward. Someone in your life may seem to be speaking a different language as they express their desire to make a change that you would never suspect. Be supportive, even if you don't agree, just to show your solidarity - but recognize that this could be a whim that will change again.","interval":"2020w01","reqDate":"2020w01"}]}
