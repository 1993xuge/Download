{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may be attracting intense, dynamic energy into your life through one of your ideas. This month, Sagittarius, it may spark and sizzle as you begin to present it or explain that idea to someone else. As you gain feedback on whatever you are creating, you may find that the great reaction you receive fuels your motivation and your inspiration, and you want desperately to get to the next level. But do remain patient, as rushing ahead could cause you to miss identifying a few potential pitfalls. If you are slow and careful, though, you will surely succeed. This month, you also have a strong propensity for partnerships and new friendships. You may meet at least a few people who are incredibly bright and interesting, and taking the time to invest in those relationships will serve you well, now and in the future. You may even choose to join a professional organization, club, or association through one of these relationships, which will open up a new world of learning and discovery for you. Someone who likes to instigate could try to push your buttons this month, Sagittarius, perhaps through a conversation where you have polar opposite viewpoints. Giving in to this kind of behavior will only lead to conflict, and you don't need that. Avoid conversations throughout this month that have the potential to start trouble. Trouble will be counterintuitive for all that you want to accomplish, so don't get distracted - and don't allow anyone to antagonize you.","interval":"2020m04","reqDate":"2020m04"}]}
