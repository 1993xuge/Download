Even if you offer a compliment on their outfit, for example, they may wonder why you didn't comment on what they wore the day before. Yes, it is sure ridiculous, but not in the eyes of that person. If someone in your life is hyper-sensitive right now, Leo, don't take it personally. There could be a deeper reason that is causing them to behave and respond in an anxious way. Try to be patient and understanding instead.","interval":"20200224","reqDate":"20200224"}]}
