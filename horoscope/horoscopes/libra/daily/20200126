Perhaps these are friends, or maybe they are family members, and they each want you on their side. But your role here will not be to choose one side over the other. No, that would only cause conflict. Your role is to help both sides find a way to meet in the middle.

Be confident as you serve as the peace magnet in the middle.","interval":"20200126","reqDate":"20200126"}]}
