{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Over the holidays, there is an intensity and a high level of expectation that can sometimes lead to conflicts with loved ones, and this can be especially painful. But this month, Sagittarius, you should find that your familial and other close connections are nothing but harmonious. Although there may be one challenging personality in the mix at times, there will be enough encouraging conversation and warm support to help you get over any rough spots. Treasure good times with your family members and keep in mind that you can maintain this with mutual respect and open communication. Around the middle of the month, you may notice that your charm and allure seem to be off the charts. You may capture a lot more attention and draw in a lot of people you wouldn't ordinarily meet. This is a good time to show off some of your best talents, as you never know who might be watching and where the next opportunity will come from. A new and intriguing friend could appear on your horizon near the end of the month. This may be someone who seems like an instant friend from the moment you first meet and who seems to get you like no one else does. The rapport should be easy, and you may even discover that you have some shared experiences. Devote some time to getting to know this person in January, for this could be the beginning of a great friendship or possibly a romance. A mutual friend could include you in a get-together this month that you might not ordinarily be invited to. Be sure to say yes, even if you feel like you don't belong. Once you meet others, you will see that this group offers a perfect fit for your personality.","interval":"2020m01","reqDate":"2020m01"}]}
