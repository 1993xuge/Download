{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You have been working hard and diligently at something, Sagittarius, and you probably realize that this effort may not bear fruit for a long time. However, you may find this week that some small reward will come to you from this effort. Although this may not be the big windfall you are expecting in the future, you should see it as a gift from the universe to offer you validation, hope, and inspiration for what is yet to come. Be very careful when sharing important thoughts and messages this week. There is some confusion and a lack of clarity in your thinking because you have so many plates spinning in the air at once. Before you say anything, put your thoughts in order and have a plan on how to present what you want to say. Doing this will help you communicate in the most clear and concise way possible. A disruption with a negotiation or a contract could occur this week, but this is not a sign that things are not going to work out. In fact, it may be just the opposite. Something could be delayed because someone is thinking things through very carefully, and it may still work out to your benefit. You may get more than you bargained for this week when a deal you made or are in the process of making comes through in a more significant way than anticipated. Don't question it. Just be grateful.","interval":"2020w02","reqDate":"2020w02"}]}
