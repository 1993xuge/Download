{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may start out feeling like a lightning rod for all kinds of trouble this week, Gemini, but it would be a mistake to think that way, really. First of all, a lightning rod is designed to attract lightning because it is metallic and it stands high above other targets. If you don't want to be the deflector or absorber of other people's problems, and maybe a few problems of your own, then you need to avoid conflict and awkward situations. You don't have to have any battles this week if you don't want to. If you want to resolve a long-standing argument or conflict with someone in your life this week, you may have to go over old ground, even if you have already done it many times. This person may have a new ability to think outside the box and may be able to better understand what you are trying to say now. Do not give up on this because once you get through, the understanding should become permanent and the conflict resolved. Someone in your life may need a big hug right now, and they may need it from you. Even though it isn't usually your way to wrap your arms around someone and tell them it will be alright - after all, that can be awkward - you should do so anyway. You may find it much easier than you thought it would be, and lifting someone else's spirit will also lift up your own.","interval":"2020w10","reqDate":"2020w10"}]}
