{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"There is a lot going on this week, Virgo - not just for you but for everyone around you. And although you may have made many commitments, you may not be in the mood to keep your promise to attend every one of them. In your enthusiasm and energy in earlier weeks, you probably thought it would be easy to keep all of your plans. But as reality sets in, you know it would be best to pick and choose carefully as to which events you really want to attend. You can only do so much, so make memorable choices and don't feel bad about bowing out of certain plans. This is a positive time to address any outstanding matters you may have with a family member. Even if you feel there is no love lost between you, not resolving this could wind up as a big regret in future years. Take some time this week to at least approach someone with whom you are estranged and express what you feel and your openness to a conversation. It can't hurt. The opportunity for a leadership role could come to you this week, bringing you the chance to branch out in an area that interests you. If others did not believe in you, then this chance would not be available to you, so do yourself a favor and believe in yourself too. You can do this.","interval":"2019w52","reqDate":"2019w52"}]}
