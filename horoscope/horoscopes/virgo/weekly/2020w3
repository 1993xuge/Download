{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You could receive an invitation to a fancy gathering at some point this week or sometime soon, but you may not be finding yourself in an appropriate mood. If you would rather just chill on the couch with a classic old film and a bucket of popcorn or enjoy a good book, then that is exactly what you should do. This is a time to cater to yourself and go with whatever moves, inspires and soothes you. An impromptu intimate gathering could lead to a romantic evening this week, Virgo, and although it may come up unexpectedly, it could definitely be quite memorable. If you are attached, this could be the beginning of an even closer year for you and your mate. If you are single, this could be a sign that you have met someone who is on the same wavelength romantically. There could be an encounter this week with a sibling or someone who is like a brother or a sister to you. This may be a continued argument over something you may see as trivial, but it may be seen in another way altogether by someone else. However, this can be a conversation that can end on a positive note if you don't become reactive or defensive, and you are patient and loving as you communicate. Home is where the heart is later in the week. You may have a strong desire to do something to spruce up your space, such as painting or decorating. Why not take some time to browse through flea markets or antique galleries for some homey touches?","interval":"2020w03","reqDate":"2020w03"}]}
