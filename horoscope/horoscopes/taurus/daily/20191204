{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You are very self-aware, Taurus, but you also have a tendency to be very critical of yourself. Sometimes you are so harsh that you blame yourself for things that go wrong that were out of your control. And when you do, you wind up feeling guilty. But blaming yourself in this way can only erode your self-confidence and your feelings of self-worth. Try to be less harsh and judgmental of yourself. Give yourself the gift of being more carefree. Doing what you feel is right at any given moment is all you need to do the right thing. Your moral compass can never lead you astray - no matter how things turn out.","interval":"20191204","reqDate":"20191204"}]}
