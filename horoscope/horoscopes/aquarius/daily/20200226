{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"No one likes a backseat driver - someone who gives driving and navigation instructions while you are trying to navigate to your destination as the driver. On the road, that can cause serious annoyance, and, even worse, distraction and possibly accidents but it can happen in everyday life situations and even though the stakes may not be as serious, it can still be quite annoying. If someone is doing the backseat driving in some areas of your life now, Aquarius, you need to hit the brakes on it. Being polite probably won't stop it. Especially if your backseat driver is pushy. Be firm and stand your ground, and remember that you are in charge of the wheel, Aquarius.","interval":"20200226","reqDate":"20200226"}]}
