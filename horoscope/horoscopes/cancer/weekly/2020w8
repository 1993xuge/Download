{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Today is the future of yesterday, Moonchild. Ponder that if you are thinking about putting off yet another plan that involves a very big dream of yours this week - perhaps your biggest dream of all. If you put it off again, even if you do so because of pressing obligations, you might never get to it since there is always something important to do. But you need to recognize that this is also extremely important. Not only can the completion of this mission enrich your life in myriad ways; it can also pave the way for other projects that reflect your heart's desires. A kindred spirit may appear to you this week in someone you have known for a long time, but never quite seen in that way. Don't disbelieve what you are seeing or feeling, because you could really use this kind of friend or romantic partner right now if you happen to be single. This is someone who understands you but may have fallen back because you unwittingly kept them at arm's length. It is worth at least exploring. Trying a new angle on your approach to an old problem could work out quite well for you. Don't be afraid to try something unorthodox because you might be onto something important. A work-related matter - in the office or in your own financial situation, might have to be dealt with this week. This may start out as a concern that something is wrong, but you may be pleasantly surprised when you find something that was overlooked, which will help resolve this fairly easily.","interval":"2020w08","reqDate":"2020w08"}]}
