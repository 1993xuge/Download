{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Many positive thinkers or self-help gurus will tell you that the more generous you are and the more you give, the more you will receive. Some call it karma, some call it life balance, others don't call it anything and just believe this to be true. But when you are feeling depleted and don't have the resources to be generous, it may seem like a battle that you just can't win. But there is always a way to be generous, even if you feel that you don't have much to share. You can give your time, your inspiration, your assistance, your shoulder to cry on, your guidance, your words of encouragement, and so on. Generosity can take many forms. Remember this today. If you feel like you have nothing to give, you'll realize that you actually have quite a lot to offer once you consider all the options.","interval":"20200126","reqDate":"20200126"}]}
