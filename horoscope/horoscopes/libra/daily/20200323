{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"If you are searching for an answer to an important question and having trouble finding it, dear Libra, you should consider why. Does it elude you no matter how hard you look and how far you go to find it? Tonight before you drift off to sleep, think about the question and ask the universe to help you find the answer. You should consider keeping a pen and a pad by your bed for when the answer comes to you. It may not come the first night on the first try, but eventually, the answer to the problem will come to you - be it while you sleep or awake. Working out challenges in the subconscious allows you to tap into a different resource and find the sometimes surprising and unexpected answers.","interval":"20200323","reqDate":"20200323"}]}
