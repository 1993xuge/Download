{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"This week may begin with a misunderstanding or with you feeling as though you have been misunderstood. You are usually so clear and so straightforward in the way you express yourself, Capricorn, but not everyone understands your vision. If you think there is a gap in communication, take some time at the beginning of the week to clarify and to ask questions that are pointed at assessing how well you have gotten through to someone. You will feel more satisfied if you do. If you have been waiting for the answer to a question or request, then you may receive it this week. Will this be the answer you have been hoping for? It may, or it may not be what you have been imagining. However, with that said, it will result in you eventually attaining exactly what you are hoping for, so relax. You may find yourself feeling more impulsive than you usually are this week, and you have to be aware of that. You could easily agree to get into something that might not be all that wise for you, so think twice and then think again if you are tempted. This is not a great week to make commitments of any kind, especially those that involve some level of risk. A frustrating exchange with a friend or family member does not have to result in a conflict. If an argument ensues, the first thing you need to do is to calm things down. Listening is the only tool you need to employ to straighten this out.","interval":"2020w12","reqDate":"2020w12"}]}
