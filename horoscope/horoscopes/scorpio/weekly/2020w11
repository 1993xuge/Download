{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Your diligent efforts at completing a seemingly impossible mission may begin to pay off this week, Scorpio. Although this payoff may not be obvious at first, you will begin to see things falling into place and a plan taking shape that will allow you to take your mission to the next level. This is something to celebrate. The week could be very busy for you on and off, and during the off times, you need to be sure to get enough rest and engage in fun and restorative moments. You tend to work until you drop, and that is not good for your state of mind or your physical health either. Second thoughts about your career path or about some long-term investment you have been considering could come to you this week. That's okay. You need to recognize that any doubts you experience are not necessarily a bad sign. You are an intellectual person, and you like to think things through thoroughly. And because you are not someone who typically shares your doubts or fears, this can be a long process for you. But don't think of it in a negative way. Just think of it as learning and evolving as you proceed down your chosen path. Later in the week, be careful not to make any assumptions about someone who enters your world through a friend or a social network, even though it might be easy to do so. What you see regarding this person may not be what you get. This is someone who may be quite complex, so make sure you don't underestimate the situation.","interval":"2020w11","reqDate":"2020w11"}]}
