{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You are someone who understands the power of the mind and positive thinking. You are the author of your life, and you can take any path you choose. But when other people are involved in manifesting a dream or completing a goal of yours, and you are reliant on their actions or choices, you can't control what they will do through positive thinking. But what you can do, Pisces, is harness the power of your mind to come up with an alternate plan - one that does not rely on someone else's agreement or actions. You have that power now with something you wish to fulfill. Use your creativity to come up with a new way to get what you want.","interval":"20191203","reqDate":"20191203"}]}
