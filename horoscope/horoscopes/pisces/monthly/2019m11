{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"At the beginning of this month, Pisces, it may feel as though you are finally emerging from a cocoon in which you have dwelled for quite some time - and you are! You have been through a process of personal evolution that has left you with a new lease on life and a more vibrant outlook on the world. Many new opportunities for happiness will come to you because of this change, and this could represent many new beginnings. A chance to review a commitment you made not long ago may come up this month. This situation has not gone as planned or as you expected, and you may have the chance to either review and revise the components or to gracefully exit the situation altogether. Do what is best for you, even if someone else is not satisfied with your decision. You may finally gain control this month over a situation in your personal life that has seemed out of control. The sense that you had no options here will change, and you may see that you do have - and probably always had - much better choices than you were aware of. Someone you meet later in the month may not make a great first impression. Since this is someone you may have to team up with to complete an objective, this could be unsettling. But don't rush to judgment. If you are willing to work patiently with this individual, you will likely see a whole new side of their personality emerge, and it will be quite pleasing and impressive. The month may end with a celebration of exciting news that comes to you unexpectedly.","interval":"2019m11","reqDate":"2019m11"}]}
