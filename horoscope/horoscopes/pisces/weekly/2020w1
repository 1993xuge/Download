{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"This week could have an air of enchantment about it from the very beginning, Pisces, suiting your style perfectly. This could have an almost storybook feel to it with wonderful moments of intense camaraderie and happiness. This could involve a romantic event with your significant other if you are attached, or with someone special, you would like to get to know if you are single. This may happen quite at the last minute and unexpectedly, and the more carefree you are about it, the more fun you will have. A touching and magical moment could occur for you this week when someone confides either a crush or expresses their great admiration for you - and this may be something you would not have expected. Take this to heart and remember it, for it is a postcard moment that should remain very meaningful to you, possibly for years to come. This is a good week to take action on a family-related decision. Whatever you choose to do should turn out well as long as everyone is on board. You may find yourself uncomfortable in the spotlight late in the week when someone pushes you out there unexpectedly. But once you get your bearings and speak about whatever you are being urged to speak about, you will find that you are right in your element. Set free your famous dramatic flair, and have fun with it.","interval":"2020w01","reqDate":"2020w01"}]}
