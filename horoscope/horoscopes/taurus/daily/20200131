{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"It may feel as though something that you want to change in your life is anchored down and impossible to move. But that may be more of a perception than reality. And where do our perceptions come from, Taurus? They come from negative thinking. You do have the power to change something that you want to change, but to do so, you will have to recognize and act on that power. So, no more thoughts about being stuck. No more thoughts about being powerless. Perception is reality, so all you really have to do is change your perception.","interval":"20200131","reqDate":"20200131"}]}
