{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Woe is me... there may be someone in your life highlighted now who seems to do nothing but complain. This week, Taurus, the complaining might finally get to you, and you could lose your temper if you don't get out of this person's way. And if you stick around, you might feel like you are losing your mind. You prefer to be around people who are happy and upbeat and who believe that anything is possible, and those are the kind of people you should surround yourself with. There are many wonderful opportunities coming to you soon, and building up your natural affinity for positive thinking will only be enhanced by being around those who lift you up rather than weigh you down. Romance is possible for you this week as well whether you are happily attached or sadly single. Those with a significant other may want to plan something special for you and your mate where the outside world cannot intrude and you can reconnect in mind, body, and spirit. If you are single, be sure to get out and about and be as outgoing as possible. Someone out there may be looking for you too! An awkward experience at work or among a group of friends could leave you bumbling and not knowing what to do. Don't take this experience in a shameful way though - everyone has moments like this, and you can turn this around into something positive if you are willing to laugh at yourself. And if you do, you will make a very positive impression on someone who can relate to you.","interval":"2020w09","reqDate":"2020w09"}]}
