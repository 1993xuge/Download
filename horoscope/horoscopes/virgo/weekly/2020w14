{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"There are times when you keep your opinions to yourself, or you walk on eggshells, or you avoid revealing some aspect of yourself that someone else does not know how to deal with. All of these things have the potential to push you deeper into yourself, but you should never be a shadow, Virgo. This week, you may encounter someone around whom you often walk on eggshells. But you may find that if you speak your truth and you are proud of who and what you are and what you stand for, it will be incredibly liberating, and it may change your interactions with this person and with others in the future. This is also a great week to begin a project you have not had time for and have set on the shelf for too long. You may find that if you start, the resources and the guidance you need will appear to you signifying that this is exactly what you need to be doing. And if you keep at it, it may turn out to play an important role in your future.","interval":"2020w14","reqDate":"2020w14"}]}
