{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may feel as though there is a proverbial angel on one of your shoulders and a devil on the other. You may be tempting yourself to take a risk on something that seems to others to be a bit too much of a risk. This is not like you, Taurus, but perhaps you are bored, or you have become so eager to change something in your life that you are willing to overlook the worrying signs. Then again, maybe you are right, and this is a unique opportunity. During this week, you should gain greater enlightenment on what to believe, what to do, and what you can expect in the near future should you decide to move ahead with this. Communication from an unusual source that arrives later this week could open up your world to a new interest or even a new job prospect. This may just be the beginning though, which will offer you the chance to learn more and evaluate whether this is a fit for you or not. Just be honest with yourself as you assess, and recognize the realities rather than the fantasy aspects of what could be.","interval":"2020w17","reqDate":"2020w17"}]}
