{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"This is a great week for you to shine, with all the right people there in your corner waiting and watching for you to dazzle. Put your best foot forward and don't leave anything out, because there could be someone there to assist you with making a splash in the way you envision. This could lead to something big before the end of this year. A task you put off for a long time may wait no longer, and this week you will have to get down to it. You may be worried about this, Gemini, because it seems like too big a task for just yourself. However, if you think positively, you can attract someone to help you. Be grateful for any assistance you receive, and be sure to pay it forward the next time you have the chance. If you find yourself in a negotiation later in the week, try to be as flexible as possible. A compromise might seem too much to deal with, but think about what you could be getting back in return. If you look at it that way, you should see the wisdom in giving in just a bit. Even if you are dealing with someone who is very demanding, a compromise could ultimately get you what is most important.","interval":"2019w47","reqDate":"2019w47"}]}
