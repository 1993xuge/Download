{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Everyone has a subtly or not-so-subtly different approach to things, but you, dear Pisces, you usually have a much more significant difference to how you approach things. When you walk into a room, you stand out. And when you create something - whether it is a painting, a sculpture, a plan, or coming up with some idea in work, business, and so on - it has your unique take and your \"signature\" on it. Someone might be trying to take credit now or profit from something you created or earned, Pisces. Even though they may have had something to do with it through support or partnership, this is still your achievement, and it represents your efforts. If you don't feel that you've been treated fairly, speak up.","interval":"20200304","reqDate":"20200304"}]}
