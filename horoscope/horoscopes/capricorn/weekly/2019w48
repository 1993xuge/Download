{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Have you ever seen a dog riding in a car, his head hanging out the window as the wind flaps his ears and there is unabashed joy on his face? This week, Capricorn, you need to find a way to capture that kind of joy in your own life. That may mean leaving behind an obligation that has been making you feel sad or trapped. It may also involve finding better ways to live in the moment. Let go of fears, surround yourself with the positive in your friendships and your activities, and make choices that are all about happiness. Practice this a little bit each day, and soon enough, it will become natural to you. A great chef is inspired by imagination. Rather than following a recipe closely, the chef may improvise and be creative in blending flavors, textures and so on. You need to emulate that approach to a new opportunity that is coming your way this week. If you go with your gut feeling each step of the way, you will come up with a masterpiece. On the weekend, be sure to retreat to your cozy nest at home for some time to decompress and to enjoy a good classic film or just a night by the fire with a good book - or whatever it takes to make you feel truly serene and peaceful. That's what you need right now.","interval":"2019w48","reqDate":"2019w48"}]}
