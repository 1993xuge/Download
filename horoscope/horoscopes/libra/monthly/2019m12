{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"A breakthrough in a venture that was stalled may happen for you in December, and it may leave you feeling incredibly charged up and ready to move forward with a plan. However, Libra, this is a good time to slow down and consider all that you have learned so that you can approach this mission in a way that will create a true reflection of your vision. If you rush into it, you may not capture all of the elements that have been so important to you. An opportunity that you have been thinking about may pose a risk that you had not detected originally. This could be a deal breaker if certain elements don't fall into place, so tread carefully to be sure this will pan out as planned. Your heart may not be in a responsibility you took on quite recently - perhaps as recent as last month. You may now feel regretful that you got involved at all, but you have to stick with it to honor a friend or family member who is counting on you. Since you have to be there, you need to just make the best of it, and the rewards that come from this will make you feel darn good about yourself. A personal relationship - perhaps one that involves romance - may be evolving quickly. Even if you have known this person for quite some time, you may find yourselves discovering new and fascinating things about each other. Like fine wine, some relationships get better with time. This may be one of those moments.","interval":"2019m12","reqDate":"2019m12"}]}
