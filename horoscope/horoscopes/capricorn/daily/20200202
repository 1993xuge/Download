{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"One of the hardest opponents to deal with - no matter what you are vying for - is a fear of the unknown. Fear can be an intimidating and often paralyzing enemy just by itslef, but when you couple that with the unknown, this is a monster that fear can keep feeding if you don't put a stop to it. We face the unknown every single day from the time we leave the house in the morning, get in the car, and on and on. But we don't usually fear our routines. Something unknown is opening up for you now and holds a lot of promise. Trust in what you feel about it - not what you can't see, Capricorn.","interval":"20200202","reqDate":"20200202"}]}
