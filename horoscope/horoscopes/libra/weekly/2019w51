{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Networking and socializing are on the agenda for you this week, Libra. And even though you are a social sign, you may not be in the mood for too much of this right now. Force yourself anyway, because you may have the chance to meet some very interesting people who can open doors to new interests and experiences. There may be a chance this week to become involved in a venture that could bring in a windfall rather quickly, so be open to considering this. You are very impressive to someone this week who may see you in a role that could bring a lot of good fortune your way. This is a great week for career planning, applying for a new job, or training for some kind of work that is new to you. You may have some big ideas where some business is concerned, and this is a great time to learn as much as you can about that so you know how to plan for it. This could be an outstanding time for you romantically too. If you are a single Libra, you may encounter someone who stirs you quite deeply on an intellectual level. And the more you learn about this person, the more you will be drawn in on other levels as well. If you are attached, your significant other may reveal something quite intriguing that you never knew or never really paid attention to, revealing a titillating aspect that comes as a pleasant surprise.","interval":"2019w51","reqDate":"2019w51"}]}
