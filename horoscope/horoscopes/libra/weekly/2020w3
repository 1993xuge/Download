{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Are you happy where you are living, Libra? Do you like the location, the scenery, and the architecture that surrounds you? Are you in close proximity to all of the things that you love? Is your living space exactly what you envisioned for this time in your life? These may all be things you are thinking about this week, as you are in a very \"hearth and home\" kind of a mood with a strong desire to find or create the kind of home environment that will bring you both inspiration and great comfort. This will be a fun quest, and it is one that you can begin now, even if you have not yet established exactly what you are looking for. Go to social media to explore ideas, search through real estate websites, look through design magazines. Even a trip to the local hardware store to scan through paint samples could give you some great ideas. Enjoy the experience and make it last. You aren't in a hurry to move or change anything just yet anyway. The start of the year is a great time for you to start a personal journal to jot down your thoughts and to keep track of your emotions and your dreams. This is a good way to get in touch with what you really want out of your life and to create solid plans and a strategy for having what you want. Although you may feel flooded with energy all week long, you need to remind yourself to take breaks, to give yourself some breathing room, and to meditate to keep anxiety at bay.","interval":"2020w03","reqDate":"2020w03"}]}
