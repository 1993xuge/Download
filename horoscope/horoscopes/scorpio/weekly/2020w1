{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"A meeting or an event you have been worried about should work out in your favor this week, Scorpio. Even though you have put in a lot of time thinking about all the things that might go wrong, you should find that this will go as smoothly as possible and will result in a very positive outcome. When this happens, be sure to make note of how much time you wasted on worry, and let that guide you in the future when worry becomes overwhelming. A relationship that has been the subject of some deep thought and concern may have caused you to wonder whether you should part ways. This week, though, you may learn something or see something that will validate your affection and your deep connection to this person and will inspire you to find ways to work better together. This may take time, but patience will have big rewards. If an investment of time and care and mutual respect is given here, this relationship could become the basis for great happiness in the future - but keep in mind that mutual respect is essential. Although it may seem an unlikely time of year to do business, this could be a good week for you to initiate or finalize a business deal. Just be sure you are well aware of the meaning behind anything you agree to, and be careful about your promises.","interval":"2020w01","reqDate":"2020w01"}]}
