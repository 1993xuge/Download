{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You have had many fine accomplishments to be proud of in your life, Taurus, but you tend to compare those achievements to what other people have achieved. What is the point in that? This week, something you deserve credit for may come to light, and you may be complimented and praised for it. Don't turn around and compare yourself to anyone else. You are unique and wonderful, and any comparisons simply aren't appropriate. Revel in the attention and seek other ways to keep evolving and reaching for your dreams. You could experience some form of healing this week from something that has been on your mind for some time. This may come in the form of closure when someone reveals some aspect of what happened that you did not know before. Or it could simply be that you find it no longer bothers you as it once did, and you can let it go. This too is something to celebrate. A committed relationship - which may be a romantic partnership but could also be a family relationship or even a friendship - may come under scrutiny by the other party this week. That does not mean that something will go wrong. It most likely means that someone is questioning their role in your life, and by reassuring them and being loving toward them you can resolve the matter. In fact, that small act of generous caring could change this relationship for the better in a very significant way.","interval":"2020w12","reqDate":"2020w12"}]}
