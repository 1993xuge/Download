Whether this is connected to your work, a relationship, or anything else, you may want to just toss up your hands and walk away from it.

In a situation like this, never underestimate the power of just stopping, taking a few deep breaths, and stepping away from whatever it is that's bugging you for a little while. Don't dwell on it.
