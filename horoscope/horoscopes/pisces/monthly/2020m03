{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may have spent a lot of time in recent months thinking about your dreams, your goals, and your fantasies for what you want your life to be like. But now, Pisces, it is time to get down to business. No more time spent fantasizing because that will get you nowhere. You tend to take a dreamy approach to life, but that will only satisfy you while you are daydreaming. This month could be a great time to begin taking the practical steps that are necessary to make some of those dreams and goals come true. You have so many options because you are an especially gifted person. In considering your creativity alone, you are so much more richly blessed than most people, and it would be a shame to waste that gift. You can start by creating a plan of action then adhering to it religiously. This month could bring a few moments of concern for an older person in your life, such as a family member. You may envision how you want their life to be, and you may find yourself striving to convince them that you are right. But you have to keep in mind that what would be right for you may not be right for this person. Instead, take some time to talk and discuss what their dreams might be, and see what you can do to help them find their way. Keep in mind this month that birds of feather usually flock together - but not always. You could meet someone in March who associates with others you cannot relate to. However, those characters might just represent one small aspect of this new person's personality, so give yourself a chance to get to know them. You may really love what you discover.","interval":"2020m03","reqDate":"2020m03"}]}
