{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You are not someone who often shares the more unique aspects of yourself. If you have a talent that is special, you don't necessarily share that with others either. You hide your uniqueness in many ways, dear Aries. Hence, you are someone who is often perceived as \"all business.\" But it can be inspiring and rewarding to let your true colors shine. And sometimes, it can bring opportunities to you that would not ordinarily come your way if no one knew about your depth and those extraordinary qualities you possess. Work on sharing more of who you are today.","interval":"20200206","reqDate":"20200206"}]}
