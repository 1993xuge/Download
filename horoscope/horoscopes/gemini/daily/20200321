{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"There are certain people in the world who are totally convinced that the world's expiration date is looming. They may even go so far as to predict a certain day that it will end, and they may have a wide variety of calamitous events that will occur when that happens. They may base their books on some novel they believe to be prescient, or on something else entirely, but it can create panic for anyone who buys into it. Throughout history, there have been many dramatic events that caused people to panic. But the world went on as usual. Today you may be influenced by such a person or persons.

Remember that this is not the first time there are such predictions, so trust that things will turn out quite well eventually, dear Gemini.","interval":"20200321","reqDate":"20200321"}]}
