{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Someone who already exists in your life may be an excellent source of advice for you this week, Capricorn. If you have been searching for wisdom in some area of your life, an untapped source is yours. Use that opportunity to ask the questions and seek the advice you need. You may want to explore feedback you receive from a trusted someone you don't usually go to for guidance - and you may find that they offer the perfect solution. The hard work you have put in on a pet project may finally begin to pay off. This week you should see signs if not actual evidence of success. Even if this is just a tiny bit of hope rather than a major milestone, you need to celebrate it. And, as you go along, make a point of celebrating each positive moment in this journey. A relationship of yours that has been up and down may be on your mind. You may be frustrated by a lack of communication. But you need to see this as being under construction or a work of art in progress because your efforts at connecting on a higher level will slowly bring you to a strong bond.","interval":"2020w16","reqDate":"2020w16"}]}
