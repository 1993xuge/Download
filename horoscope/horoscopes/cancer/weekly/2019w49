{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"A kind comment at just the right moment can inspire, motivate, and sometimes even save someone's life. This is something you are especially good at, Moonchild, because you understand what it is like to hide away from the world when things don't feel right, when you are afraid, or when things seem hopeless. Your empathy is well known as a hallmark of your character, and you are often the go-to person in your circle of family and friends when someone needs encouragement. You may have the chance to offer your special something to someone in great need. Don't downplay your role here. Not only can you do something for someone else, but by recognizing the great gift this is, you should feel very good about yourself as well. A bad dream isn't something frightening or upsetting that you need to get over the next morning. A bad dream usually comes about because there is something bothering you, and it may be too upsetting to deal with in your conscious mind; so your subconscious creates a dream as a way of reliving this and handling it in such a way. But if you strive to forget it, you may miss out on a good lesson. If a dream has recurred - even a daydream - don't ignore it. Working through this will help you find closure or a solution to a problem that is heavy on your mind.","interval":"2019w49","reqDate":"2019w49"}]}
