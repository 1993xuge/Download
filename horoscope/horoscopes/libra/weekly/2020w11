{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Nothing says \"I care\" more than doing something for someone when they are in desperate need of assistance. If you drop everything and rush to help someone out this week, you will not only be owed a big favor, but you may find a great and lasting sense of fulfillment that you had not expected. And even if you do drop everything, Libra, you should have time this week to pick it back up pretty quickly and get back on track since your energy levels should be high. You may be internalizing someone's criticism or negative commentary this week. You tend to take things personally, and when there is even a hint that someone does not like or appreciate something you have done, it can hurt you deeply. But it could be a simple misunderstanding of someone's intended thoughts. Ask questions if you are not sure. A plan that is pulled together at the last minute could go haywire at the last minute this week. But whatever you do, do not panic. This can be pulled back together very quickly and efficiently if you keep a level head and aren't afraid to ask for help. This may also give you a chance to show off your leadership skills and your ability to be innovative. You may be thinking about joining a new club or organization, perhaps related to a personal hobby. This could be a great way to meet like-minded friends. If you haven't done much for your social life lately, this would be a great chance to get out and mingle.","interval":"2020w11","reqDate":"2020w11"}]}
