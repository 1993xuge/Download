{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"This is a great week to celebrate yourself, Aries, and what better way to do that than with some self-care indulgences. For example, a massage could help you relax and focus inward. A facial could help you refresh the face you see in the mirror every morning. A haircut or a manicure can also make you feel more polished. If you don't have the time or the funds for one of these, Aries, then some time alone with the curtains drawn and the phone off while you listen to soothing music, maybe burn incense, and relax could do the trick as well. It's all about consciously taking the time to make yourself feel pampered. You will need to revive your enthusiasm and your energy this week to meet an upcoming opportunity with open arms and a positive vibration. A chance is coming your way to fulfill a lifelong desire, and you will want to be at your best. When this chance arrives, set aside any doubts about whether you can handle it, and remind yourself that you are worthy of something so wonderful, and that you deserve nothing less than taking the time to invest in yourself in this way. A circulating rumor may arrive at some point later in the week, but pay it no mind. If you allow yourself to get upset over something that you hear, you will waste a lot of your precious time in a pointless way. An explanation or a confirmation that this is nothing to worry about or to take seriously should arrive not long afterward.","interval":"2019w52","reqDate":"2019w52"}]}
