{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"From the very beginning of this week, Aries - and perhaps trailing into this week from last - you may be feeling especially adventurous. Even though there may be a few areas of your life where you are feeling apprehensive, in most cases you are raring to go off on an adventure. Even if that is not possible right now though, you can get some fulfillment by leafing through travel magazines or searching for extraordinary destinations to dream about visiting one day. And adventure does not have to mean \"travel\" alone. It can also mean exploring new ideas, visiting local points of interest, or getting to know someone that you find intriguing and exciting. This week also offers the chance to rest and relax a bit more than you have been able to do in the last few weeks, and you should definitely take advantage of this whenever you can. You can spend time with people you have been missing, catch up with your reading, learn something new, or indulge in a neglected hobby. All of these can help you find balance again. You could get to know someone from an entirely different background from yours this week too. This could be interesting in many ways, including how you see the world around you. By the end of the week, you may have the chance to get reacquainted with an old chum from your childhood or from an old workplace. This person might even be able to introduce you to a new and fun social group.","interval":"2020w09","reqDate":"2020w09"}]}
