{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"If you can get past a challenging issue early in the week, you can have a tremendously productive and successful week, Moonchild. However, this challenge could involve another person, and you may feel as though you are reliant on this person's cooperation to get this done. But if all else fails, this is certainly something that you can take on and accomplish on your own, so don't stand on ceremony. Even though that may not be the ideal way to proceed, it could work out quite well if you are willing to try. You may find yourself in a standoff with someone in a position of authority this week. Although this person might \"outrank\" you in some way, if you speak the truth, you have nothing to lose. In fact, doing so would be quite noble because you would be standing up not only for yourself but for others who may not be able to say anything. Teaming up with the right person this week could help you get ahead by leaps and bounds on a mission aimed at making money. Together you could combine your individual talents to come up with a very interesting and exciting presentation.","interval":"2019w47","reqDate":"2019w47"}]}
