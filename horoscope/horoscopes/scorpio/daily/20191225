A letter might have taken a few days - or in some cases maybe even weeks to arrive - and it was treasured. And you could be sure that every word was carefully and lovingly chosen. Today we communicate via text in a kind of shorthand, sometimes not even spelling out words entirely. This often leaves much to the imagination and sometimes not in a good way. You have an important message to share with someone now, Scorpio. Choose every word carefully and lovingly to get your message across the way you want it.","interval":"20191225","reqDate":"20191225"}]}
