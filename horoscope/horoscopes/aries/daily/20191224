{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"There were many underdogs throughout history that no one believed in, yet they rose to achieve enormous success. The key to their success was their belief in themselves, despite any lack of support, or even discouragement and mistreatment they experienced from those who didn't believe in them. You may be facing an opportunity now that no one else believes you can master, Aries, but if you believe in yourself, that will be all that you need. It is always nice to have others in your corner, cheering you on and bringing up all of your many virtues, and you may have to do that for yourself right now. But you can do this - believe it.","interval":"20191224","reqDate":"20191224"}]}
