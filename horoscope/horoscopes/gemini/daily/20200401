{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"The adage \"it's always darkest before the dawn\" may be overused and it may be a clich\u00e9, but it certainly could apply to you right now. Yours is a quick-thinking, fast-moving sign, and a period of inertia can be difficult. But it is important to remember that the dark will not last forever, and what's more, good things can happen in the dark. You can light a candle, start a cozy fire, get a good night's rest, contemplate and plan for your life in peaceful silence, and so on. Don't focus on what you can't do, Gemini. Choose to focus on what you can do. There is much good that you can accomplish right now.","interval":"20200401","reqDate":"20200401"}]}
