{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You have been very driven recently, Libra, but this week can be a time to recapture your joy and to dwell more on your personal interests. You will need to set aside some of the pursuits that you take so seriously to give this time to yourself, but new opportunities for enjoyment and carefree moments should appear in your path if you are open to taking that route. You may have the chance this week to survey the part of your life that involves love and romance and to figure out what is working and what is not so that you gain an understanding of an important relationship. A clash of personalities may occur between two people in your life that you value greatly this week, and they may each try to drag you into the middle of it. Try to stay out of it. Getting involved would be a mistake because it could wind up alienating you from everyone involved. Instead, remain neutral and perhaps steer clear until the dust settles. You may find yourself nursing an emotional wound, but indulging in a talent that you love could be quite therapeutic and will help to provide speedy and efficient healing this week. Whether this is painting or writing or pottery, the effort put forth could open up pathways to a greater understanding of yourself and of others. Whatever you choose to do that brings you a sense of serenity, you need to do this for yourself as often as possible. Working it in as part of your regular schedule would be a great idea.","interval":"2019w49","reqDate":"2019w49"}]}
