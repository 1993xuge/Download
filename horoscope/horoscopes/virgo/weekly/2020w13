{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Do you have as much money as you want? Do you have as many friends as you would like to have? How about where you live - is it a reflection of your ideals? We all have things to aspire to, some of them are tangible and some of them are not. This week, Virgo, you are receiving a boost in power from the universe, and whatever you reach for will come closer and will be easier to pursue than it has been in quite some time. So, don't waste a precious moment. If you find yourself in conflict with a friend or a family member this week, remember that the moment the conflict begins is the very best time to nip it in the bud. You have the power to stabilize an argument and to make it productive rather than harsh. There is always something to learn when you have a difference of opinion with someone. You may be receiving what you perceive to be very clear signs to move forward with something. But being a highly practical Virgo, you may be afraid to listen to your intuition. But ask yourself: what can it hurt? Go for it.","interval":"2020w13","reqDate":"2020w13"}]}
