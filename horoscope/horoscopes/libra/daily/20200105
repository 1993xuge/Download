{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"There are some people who confine their dogs in their yards with an \"invisible\" fence. An invisible fence consists of an electrified wire that is enclosed in a trench under the lawn, and a dog collar that gives off a shock when the dog approaches that wire; thereby creating a boundary the dog won't cross. Although there is no electrical current keeping you away from a dream of yours, Libra, there is a fear or an insecurity that has created a boundary - but you can turn that off by exploring how you feel and overcoming it if you consciously and methodically work on that, dear Libra.","interval":"20200105","reqDate":"20200105"}]}
