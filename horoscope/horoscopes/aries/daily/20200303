That's the advice given in the song \"Smile\", which was co-written by Charlie Chaplin and sung by Nat King Cole among many others. But smiling through troubled times can be a challenging thing to do, isn't it, Aries? You may be facing some aggravating personal challenges now, and you probably don't feel like smiling. Try to smile anyway. No, it won't immediately reverse your situation. But if you are persistent, smiling can turn into hopefulness. And hopefulness can draw a positive influence into your life. So, Aries, smiling really can change things for the better. Try it, and stick with it.","interval":"20200303","reqDate":"20200303"}]}
