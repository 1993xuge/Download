{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You know very well that you can disagree with someone - and you can even have a passionate argument with someone - without being harsh or unkind. But someone you may have to deal with this week has not learned that lesson. If someone you are debating or arguing with over a matter that is important to you becomes unkind, take it in stride and don't take it personally. Someone may try to encourage you this week to take a leap with a big opportunity. You may not feel ready for it, Sagittarius, or you may not feel that you are capable of doing whatever is demanded, but you owe it to yourself to learn as much as you can before you write it off. If you do, you may discover that it's a perfect fit, and you may wish to pursue it. You may still wonder about a regret that occurred many years ago. This could be a chance that you took but did not put your all into. You may wish you had the chance to try again. And although the same exact opportunity may not come up in the future, you can do something this week to begin to manifest the same dream, but in a different way. Go for it, and this could erase the regret that keeps haunting you. A logical approach to a convoluted problem will help you sort it out fairly easy this week. Don't get too caught up in the details, though, or it could become rather confusing. Just stick to the most salient facts and work through it methodically. You will figure it out.","interval":"2019w50","reqDate":"2019w50"}]}
