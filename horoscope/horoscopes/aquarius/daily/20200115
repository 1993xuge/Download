{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Several different people can look at the same painting in a gallery and see and feel very different things. The colors, the subject matter, the tone of the painting and more can all contribute to what someone takes from it. And those feelings come from their own experiences. A certain color might feel inspirational to one person, or it might feel negative to someone else based on their own personal experience. Don't let someone else's perception today alter the way you see an opportunity. See it through your own eyes, and make any decisions based on your own perception, Aquarius.","interval":"20200115","reqDate":"20200115"}]}
