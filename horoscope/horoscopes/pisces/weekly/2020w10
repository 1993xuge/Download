{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"News you receive this week from a dear friend or family member may actually complicate your relationship this month, Pisces. Although it would be good news, it may have a profound impact on the way you relate to this individual. With patience and insight, though, you can navigate this change successfully. Some change associated with your work life or with financial security is now evolving for you, and although this is an area where you may have more than a few insecurities, you can navigate this quite successfully if you are cautious and open to suggestions. Don't worry - worry is your enemy with any issues connected to security. Just remember that you have a powerful mind and you can do anything you want to do with your special brand of creative magic. You could encounter someone this week who can offer you guidance through the spiritual realms, most likely related to getting in touch with the power within your own soul. Metaphysical topics are something you may think about a lot, and this person will be on your wavelength. Seek out new ways to strengthen your connection via mind, body, and spirit, and you can find ways to improve your happiness and your well-being overall. Someone who appears to be calling the shots in some pursuit of yours may not have as much power as they imply. Don't worry that they will be able to control what you do. If you allow your unique light to shine brightly, you will become like a beacon to those who really hold the power.","interval":"2020w10","reqDate":"2020w10"}]}
