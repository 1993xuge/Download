{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may find that a seemingly random message keeps coming to you in a lot of different ways and from a lot of different sources this week. But there is nothing random about this, Gemini. When someone continues to receive the same message or see the same sign, it is a message meant for you from the universe. Even if it does not make sense to you at first, be sure to remain aware of this message and explore its meaning. If you do remain alert to it, you may find some guidance you have been waiting for. A cloudy morning does not guarantee a cloudy afternoon. You know this to be true, but you must also recognize that this philosophy affects other areas of life beyond the weather. Something you began not long ago may seem to have a dark cloud hovering over it, but that cloud is not stationary - it is moving, and soon it will move right past you. Keep plugging away with faith, and you will soon see. An old friend with whom you are not as close with - as you once were - may express the desire to rekindle your friendship this week. You may want to go back and review the reasons you grew apart, but why bother? If you enjoy this person's company, then there is no reason to be standoffish. There is no big commitment to getting to know someone again, so why not give it a shot?","interval":"2020w05","reqDate":"2020w05"}]}
