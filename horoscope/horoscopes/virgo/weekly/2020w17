{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may be feeling that a relationship of yours is not all you envision it to be, Virgo. You may have heard this from others, but you have not been open to facing that truth. This week, the interrelationship developments between you and someone close may open your eyes to certain aspects in the connection you preferred not to notice previously. However, that does not mean that you need to make drastic changes - it just means that you can work on making things better once you acknowledge what might be off-balance. You may have felt quite restricted in a role you play at work or in an organization or community. This week, certain limits will be lifted giving you more freedom so you can begin experience greater autonomy. Move slowly, though, because you will want to get your bearings to be sure of yourself, which will eventually lead to even more freedom. The way you see someone could shift this week when you see them in a new and endearing light. This could help you break through a communication gap making it easier to talk and to share with this person, which could lead to a much closer and more rewarding bond.","interval":"2020w17","reqDate":"2020w17"}]}
