{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may be in a hurry to plant the seed of a dream you have been harboring, Leo. This week, you can plant that seed, but you do have to have realistic expectations. There is a lot to do, and you can make a huge leap this week in getting things done, but this may be a slower process than you would like. Even so, the rewards, when they do start coming in, will make it well worth the wait. Be patient with yourself. If there is something you would like to learn that has a monetary connection - either for a money-making venture or to manage your own investments - you might want to look into a class or a seminar. This is a great time for financially-related pursuits for people born under your sign. You could meet a kindred spirit this week in some unlikely way or place. This is someone who could fill a need in you that your other friends and family members just don't fill, and could lift your spirits just through their presence. Take time to cultivate this relationship. Some aspect of your career may be on your mind now, and this is a good week to start exploring professional organizations to join. This could assist you in both learning and networking. You may even meet some folks who could also become good, solid friends with a common foundation you can share and relate to.","interval":"2020w03","reqDate":"2020w03"}]}
