{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Love may be on your mind this week, Scorpio. If you are single, someone special could catch your eye. Although you are a very sexy sign, you are also someone who tends to be very private. Your attraction to someone new may help to draw you out of your shell and become more open to sharing who you are on a deeper level, and that's a good thing. If you are attached, you may discover something endearing about your mate that you never knew, and it could be quite intriguing. This week may also bring a rare chance to manifest a long-time dream or to at least take the first steps toward doing so. This may come through a friend of a friend or someone who is on the periphery of your life - someone you would least expect to offer you this unique opportunity. Did someone deprive you of the chance to get proper credit for a big achievement? This may have happened because of jealousy. But this week you may see an indication that you will have that chance again, and it could even bring you some kind of reward or recognition, or it may open an important door for you. There may be signs of hope that a project that was abandoned has a chance to be revived, and this could be very meaningful to you on many levels. This could bring you a chance to fulfill an old promise to yourself.","interval":"2019w50","reqDate":"2019w50"}]}
