If you find a penny face-side-up on the sidewalk, and you are someone who believes in signs, it may seem like an indicator of good fortune to come (if you believe in that particular omen). And when you believe in something, Virgo, it makes you feel more positive and hopeful, which in turn makes every interaction more positive and hopeful.
