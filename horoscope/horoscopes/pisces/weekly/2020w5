{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Your vivid imagination and your colorful personality will make you a star this week in some impressive circles. You may receive the chance to shine your brilliant best when an opportunity to jump into a venture comes to you. Don't be shy, Pisces, and don't you dare doubt your abilities. You do have what it takes, so remember that always. An older friend or family member may come to you offering advice this week. Even though you may not have asked anyone for guidance, this person has your best interests at heart and does have the capacity to help you out in a big way. Listen to what they have to say. Don't be stubborn, even if your preference is to be completely independent. What you learn from this person will actually help you become more independent than you have ever been in this area of your life. Don't allow your emotions to get out of control later in the week in response to someone's commentary or opinion. This does not have to affect you if you don't allow it, and it should really have no impact on your life whatsoever. Sometimes you need to remind yourself not to care so much about what other people think. And losing control of your emotions will only harm you and no one else. The week should end on a high note for you when a wonderful friend pops up with ideas for an interesting excursion.","interval":"2020w05","reqDate":"2020w05"}]}
