{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"There is an old adage that says, \"One bad apple can spoil the bunch.\" This is, technically, true. It occurs when the mold from one bad apple spreads to the others. This is meant to convey that one person's bad attitude can spread to someone else. This is certainly also true. That's why, Capricorn, if you find yourself among a group of people - or even one person - who is extremely negative, it is good to get some space or to simply be very conscious to keep your own mood uplifted. Negativity spreads quite easily, and you need to be extra positive today to take advantage of an opportunity.","interval":"20200206","reqDate":"20200206"}]}
