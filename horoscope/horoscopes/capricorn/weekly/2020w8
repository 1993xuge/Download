{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may feel like slowing down at the start of this week on a project that has been very intense, time-consuming, and problematic. Maybe you feel like you need a big break, Capricorn, but you are almost at a point where a break will come naturally, so keep going. Don't worry about this going on and on without relief, just focus on taking care of business, and it will all fall into place. An unexpected change in a plan or in your schedule may seem upsetting and possibly even like a big disappointment at first, but it should ultimately turn out to be quite positive and might even prove to be a lucky break. You may notice something that needs to be done in a different or better way, or the break may give you a chance to get in on something else that appeals to you. Be very careful not to let impulse take over where money is concerned around the middle of the week. This is unlike you, but frustration or a need for an outlet may cause you to splurge on something in a way that will bring regret later. Make your health and well-being a priority this week by starting an exercise plan if you haven't yet, and do something that can enhance your peace of mind, whatever that may be. For some, it might mean taking a few minutes each day to do something relaxing, such as listening to classical music, dancing to the music in your head, or simply taking a walk in nature.","interval":"2020w08","reqDate":"2020w08"}]}
