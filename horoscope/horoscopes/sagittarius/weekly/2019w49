{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"An intense exchange could happen in a long-term relationship this week. While this could happen at the beginning of the week, you can't allow it to set the tone for the days that follow. In fact, Sagittarius, you have the power at the onset to point this in another direction if you don't get too caught up in proving you are right and proving that someone else is wrong. Work it out with peace as your primary goal. As the week progresses, you may find that you interpreted a mixed message in the wrong way, but you certainly can't blame yourself for that. Expressing a mixed message is rather passive-aggressive in the first place, and is meant to control and manipulate. You did your best to figure out the related situation, and there will be light shed on this in the days ahead. This is a great week to clear out some emotional clutter. A conversation might bring some issues to the forefront of your mind, and you need to address each one individually and work through it carefully. This will leave you feeling freer and happier than you have in some time. Someone in your life may have a skeleton in their closet that you don't know about, but it could creep out into the open this week. This may have been kept secret for fear of the reaction, but it really isn't a big deal by any standards - and it could explain a few things. Expressing reassurance of this will make things easier.","interval":"2019w49","reqDate":"2019w49"}]}
