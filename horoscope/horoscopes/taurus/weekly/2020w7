{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"From the very beginning of the week, Taurus, there may be a spring in your step. You may not be able to explain it, because there may be no identifiable reason for how good you are feeling. There is just a positive vibration surrounding you and lifting you up so that you can see your life from an elevated, happier point of view. This should continue for a while, so this is a great time to work on those projects that are most meaningful to you, for you can have even greater success when you are feeling successful. Your work environment, whether it is actually in an office, outdoors, or in the comfort of your home where you work on projects that are important to you, should feel stable and secure this week. There may be quite a lot to do - in fact, perhaps even more than usual - but it will be easier, and the time should fly by quickly because you are enjoying yourself more than usual. You can keep this momentum up by choosing to enjoy what you are doing and by working on meaningfully existing - within each moment. You have needed a break from someone in your life who seems to invite tension and anxiety. It isn't that you don't like or enjoy this person - there are moments when you are grateful to have this individual in your life - but sometimes they are just too intense. This week, you may get that break, and you will be able to return to the connection in a more patient and lax state of mind.","interval":"2020w07","reqDate":"2020w07"}]}
