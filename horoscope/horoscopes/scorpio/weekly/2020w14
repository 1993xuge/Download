{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may be feeling flattened, burnt out, or you may have a generally dreary outlook at the beginning of this week. Is that a realistic way to think? Only you can answer that. You have the power to not only change the way you feel about your life and about your future, but dwelling on negative thoughts is not the way to change anything. This week, work on building up your enthusiasm for your life, your dreams, and your future. You have the ability to pull good opportunities into your life, but if you allow negative thoughts to remain, they will act as a barrier between you and all the good things you could ever want. Practice the law of attraction, Scorpio. Believe in and draw in what you want. A creative approach to a dull problem this week will liven things up and may even attract some help from someone who might not otherwise be interested. Since you may need help with this, don't be afraid to show and share your passion for a certain project. That way, you will allow others to tap into that dynamic.","interval":"2020w14","reqDate":"2020w14"}]}
