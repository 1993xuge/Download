{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"If you are hoping to convince someone to join a mission of yours, dear Sagittarius, be careful that you don't get swept up in the passion of the moment as well as your desire for a partner and exaggerate the premise. You may not be aware of this possibility if you don't make yourself conscious of how determined you are, so think through anything you say. This mission does hold a lot of promise, and being completely straightforward will draw in just the right kind of help. Someone may criticize some work you are doing that you feel proud of, or they may disapprove of some choice you are about to make. Since you probably didn't ask for feedback, this would be unsolicited critique or advice, which may be very frustrating. So, before you respond, take a deep breath and recognize that this is not a problem for you. Tune out anything you don't want to hear rather than reacting in a harsh way. You may need the help of the \"advice-giver\" in the future, so remaining on good terms could be important. Your future security may be in focus with a negotiation or a conversation you have late in the month - or at least you may be putting a lot of weight on this situation. Be more lighthearted because you will attract the most positive energy if you don't get caught up in fearful thoughts. At the end of the month, validation for something you believed in may come to you in a delightful and surprising way.","interval":"2019m11","reqDate":"2019m11"}]}
