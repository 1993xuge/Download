{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"If you find that your life has been a bit intense and the pace has been frantic in recent weeks, don't hesitate to schedule some personal time for yourself each day this week. The intensity is definitely winding down, but you may have to help it out by knowing just how much you can reasonably take on. You have a tendency to take on a lot because of your ambitious nature, Capricorn, but sometimes your plate is so full that it takes a major juggling act just to keep everything going. So, the key to reducing stress for you this week will be knowing when to say no - and then saying no. You may also have the chance this week to get away from it all with a drive through the country, an excursion to a favorite spot, or to a social event where you can kick back and forget about all of your obligations. You may be tempted to make a promise this week to get something you want related to a career or money-related opportunity, but if keeping that promise will be a struggle, you may want to think twice. There could be a much easier way to get what you want that does not involve making promises to someone else. You may find yourself feeling a bit day-dreamy toward the end of the week, but being the driven person that you are, you may shrug this off. However, indulging in a daydream when the mood strikes could lead to some productive goal-planning, so go for it.","interval":"2019w52","reqDate":"2019w52"}]}
