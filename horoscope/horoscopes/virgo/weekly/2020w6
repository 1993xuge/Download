{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"They say that time flies when you are having fun, and that it drags when you are doing something that you don't particularly want to do. You may find yourself responsible for completing a rather dull or monotonous task this week, but you really don't have to drag it around like a ball and chain. If you find a way to make it interesting - through research, learning, challenging yourself, and so on - you can find a way to enjoy this experience rather than dread it. A negotiation may intensify this week that is connected to a legal matter, a contract, or money. You are very good at this sort of thing, but don't assume that you know everything, even if you have worked hard at studying all the ins and outs. Ask around and see if there is someone who might be able to guide you, or to at least offer feedback on your thoughts or strategy, and you can come up with an invincible plan. Someone you had planned to take on as a partner or a helper may wind up having a change of heart, but that doesn't mean that everything will go sour for you. This week, it would benefit you to look into other options just to have as a back-up plan. Being prepared is never a bad thing, and it can also give you the confidence you need to move ahead without any worries. On the weekend, be sure to do at least one thing to relax and rejuvenate your spirits. That way you will be feeling refreshed by the time Monday rolls around again.","interval":"2020w06","reqDate":"2020w06"}]}
