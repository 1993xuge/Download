{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"This is a great week to take account of not just your money situation, dear Scorpio, but also the people and the things in your life that either lift you up or drag you down. If you are feeling out of balance or out of step with someone or something this week, this is the perfect time to figure it all out. You will be assisted by the good vibrations that surround you, which will open you up to be more insightful about such things. It is all a matter of knowing what is good for you and what is not so good for you and separating the two into categories. Once you can see it all clearly, you can begin making important decisions about what to keep and what to let go of. Have you had thoughts of travel recently? If so, you may have the chance to explore travel connected to your work or to your interest in starting a business or investment. Although this will be mostly work-centered, there should be time to do whatever you find interesting. But even if a chance like this does not seem viable for you, there could be other travel options on your horizon. It doesn't have to be spring to do some spring cleaning, and that would be a great exercise for you right now. Cleaning out the closets and the junk drawers will allow you to get better organized, and therefore be more efficient and productive. These things will be important to you this week and in the weeks ahead when your agenda becomes full and very busy. If you are prepared, you will be more productive and be able to get more things done.","interval":"2020w09","reqDate":"2020w09"}]}
