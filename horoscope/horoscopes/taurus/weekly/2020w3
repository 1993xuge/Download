{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Someone's irreverent or humorous comment could open up a Pandora's box of emotions from deep within you this week, dear Taurus, and you may not understand why. Whatever is said could strike a sensitive chord, and your first instinct may be to ignore it. But if you work through it, you may be able to figure out something about yourself that has baffled you for quite some time. This is a great week to surround yourself with your most inspirational and supportive friends and relatives. You may be on the verge of working through a new idea that could potentially bring greater security to your life. When you are around those who understand you and recognize your uniqueness, you will be even more likely to believe in your ideas and to follow through on them. Something you have put off repeatedly - perhaps from even as far back as several months ago - is knocking at the back of your mind. You still have to get this done, so you might as well buckle down and do it this week. Then just think - you can finally let it go and forget about it. Something you have wanted to do for some time keeps coming to mind, and you keep turning yourself down because of the cost or the time involved. But you deserve a little splurge for yourself. And if this is something that has consistently appealed to you, then as long as it is enjoyable, it will be well worth it.","interval":"2020w03","reqDate":"2020w03"}]}
