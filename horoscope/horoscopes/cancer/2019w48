{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Romance may be on your mind this week as you contemplate the future with or without a partner, Moonchild. If you are attached, you may be wishing for a more idealized connection with your mate, and you may start pondering ideas for making that happen - such as an impromptu trip to a cozy bed and breakfast in Vermont, or a lovely homemade meal by the fireplace with music playing in the background. If you are single, the aim might be to get out there and meet someone who is very special because you aren't one to play the field. Be careful in your selection process, asking those who know you best for an introduction to someone they think might match you. An unconventional approach to a creative concept this week could land you in the spotlight with someone who has influence. If you are aiming to make a change at work or in your career or business, this could be a great week to start that process. But don't start by jumping right into the thick of it. Take as much time as you need to explore and consider all your options.","interval":"2019w48","reqDate":"2019w48"}]}
