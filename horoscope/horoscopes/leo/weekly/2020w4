{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"As a passionate admirer of the world around you, you may also be a bit of a flea market collector, art gallery buyer, or just someone who picks up interesting objects here and there. If that's the case and you have found your life to be getting a bit cluttered with all of your \"stuff,\" Leo, you may want to spend this week doing a bit of decluttering. Just grab a bag each day and fill it. Either give away what you can't use, throw away what is no longer useful, or set objects aside for a future garage sale. You will feel so much lighter by the end of the week. There may be something about yourself that you have had difficulty accepting, but this is a time when you need to resolve to accept yourself for everything you are - not just your virtues. Anything you believe you need to change can be changed, but loving yourself in your entirety is important as you strive toward self-improvement. There should be a powerful shift this week where your good fortune is concerned as connected to an important goal. While this may have felt blocked for some time, something should break free, finally providing you with the connections and resources you need to get this done. Make the most of this opportunity if one presents itself.","interval":"2020w04","reqDate":"2020w04"}]}
