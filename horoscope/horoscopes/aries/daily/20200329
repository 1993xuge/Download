There are always unpleasant chores to complete. There are often conflicts. There may be things to worry about if we dwell on them. In short, there is always something that could spoil an otherwise perfect day. But in a sense, true perfection is appreciating each day for what it is. If you learn from it and find joy in the small moments that put a smile on your face, then every day of yours would be a perfect day.","interval":"20200329","reqDate":"20200329"}]}
