{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"A bridge that was burned in your life long ago may show signs of being rebuilt this week, even if you had nothing to do with it. But if this is something that you want, Gemini, you will eventually have to take part in the rebuilding process. It may not be easy, but if what happened with a certain relationship way back when has been a source of regret for you, then this will be your chance to make things right and put it back on track. It may be awkward at first, but the rewards will be worth it. If self-improvement in some area of your life has been on your mind, you need to remember that it isn't just about saying positive things out loud - you must also apply what you believe to your life on a moment-by-moment basis. It has been said that if you can implement a change for thirty days, you can make it a habit, so invest that much time in this mission. You may sense distrust from someone newer in your life this week, but don't take it personally. Since you have done nothing to cause a lack of trust, this may be the way this person relates to everyone. Just be yourself and allow this individual to get to know you, and it will all fall into place. You could come a small step closer to a big dream this week. Even though this is just a small step, you need to use it as a source of inspiration and motivation because that will take you the rest of the way.","interval":"2020w08","reqDate":"2020w08"}]}
