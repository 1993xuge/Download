{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"\"Que sera, sera, what will be will be. The future's not ours to see. Que sera, sera.\" That line from the hit song recorded by Doris Day in 1956 promoted a rather laissez-faire attitude toward life. We can't, after all, control everything, and coming to accept what we can't control can be a mentally healthy way to go about life because it promotes contentment, which in turn promotes well-being. This week, Leo, this is something you should adhere to, perhaps using this song as your mantra. There are some things you will not be able to control no matter how hard you try, but great things can happen anyway if you just relax and go with the positive vibrations you are riding on right now. Thinking outside the box - although you may see that as clich\u00e9 - is precisely the right way to approach a goal this week. You need to go beyond what is expected and surprise everyone with something that is uniquely you and supremely creative, even if you think it came out of left field. There is something to be said for the surprise factor for you now, and pulling off an offbeat presentation could score you big points with important people. Is there a number or a word that keeps popping up for you now? If so, this could be significant. It could relate to something that you need to think about and learn from. Pay attention to this and the circumstances that surround it to figure it out.","interval":"2020w11","reqDate":"2020w11"}]}
