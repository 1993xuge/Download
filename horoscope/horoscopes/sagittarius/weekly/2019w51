{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"If you start out this week feeling very optimistic, it isn't because you are delusional - and it isn't wishful thinking. You are picking up on the abundance and prosperity that surrounds you now. And although that feeling may be quite uplifting, Sagittarius, following through on whatever opportunities land in your life will be extremely important. There are good vibrations for you now that are connected to work, money, and romance. Remain positive and tap into the vibes that appeal to you. If you have been thinking about making some positive personal changes related to your physical fitness and overall well-being, this is a great time to start. Many people wait until the New Year to get started with resolutions in these and other areas, but if you start thinking and planning now, then begin implementing before the end of this year, you will have a head start and will already be feeling sassy and happy before the year ends. Likewise, starting to clear your life of any unwanted situations or even clutter can only add to your sense of contentment, so get moving on that as well this week. And if you have not yet started to plan any entertaining or any special festivities for the upcoming holidays, you better get to it. Getting everything in order this week will alleviate any stress you may be feeling and will enhance the joy of the season.","interval":"2019w51","reqDate":"2019w51"}]}
