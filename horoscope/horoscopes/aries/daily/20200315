{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"The best way to deal with someone's emotional upheaval today is to be the voice of calm and to communicate honestly. Even though it may seem like engaging with a seemingly irrational person who is only asking for trouble, serving as the \"anchor\" by being reasonable and relaxed will inspire a healing exchange.
