{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"It is not a sin to not know what you want in an important situation. It is also not a sign of immaturity or a lack of commitment or that you are not taking the matter seriously. Sometimes it is more about feeling right with what you are doing, and if you haven't found that yet in this situation, Sagittarius, then feeling bad about it won't change anything. Instead, you need to find a way to be sure - or to look for other alternatives if you can't find a way to feel sure. Be productive by handling this in a rational, reasonable way.","interval":"20200119","reqDate":"20200119"}]}
