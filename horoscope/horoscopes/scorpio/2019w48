{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may be wondering this week if all of the blood, sweat and tears you have put into a certain venture will ever be rewarded. You may be developing this fear because other people have been warning you that you are on a wild goose chase. Don't let anyone fire you up and make you paranoid, Scorpio. You know what you are doing, so you need to keep reminding yourself of that. Someone may come across as rather power hungry this week in an exchange that starts out as a simple conversation. This may involve a role you have taken on, and this may be an authority figure. However, you are under no obligation to continue if you feel you are not being treated fairly, which is of paramount importance. A plan could fall through late in the week, only to be replaced with a better, brighter plan, so don't despair. If you are flexible, you will glide from one thing to another with ease. Just remain dedicated to getting this done, and stay hopeful as you swirl through the process.","interval":"2019w48","reqDate":"2019w48"}]}
