{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Leo, this week should be alternating between quiet and exciting for you, and you shall find both of these moods to be quite enjoyable. During the quiet times, be sure to take pleasure in the things you enjoy most, and during the exciting times, take action on as much as possible. You can get a lot done this week, and given the tone of the time you spend, it will be both invigorating and relaxing, and the perfect atmosphere for positive achievements. There could be quite a lot happening that will lift your spirits. This may include visits from friends who always make you smile, news from family or friends about happy events in their lives, answers to applications or questions you have asked that will bring you great joy, and so on. Yours is a very ambitious sign, and you may have been on a mission recently to accomplish something that would bring in more money, more prestige for your reputation, or more likely both of these things. This week, you should be able to make major headway on this project if you remain focused and upbeat. A relationship matter, perhaps related to family could come full circle this week as well. Something can be resolved that was seemingly unresolvable not long ago with a major player having a big change of heart. This should work out very well for you. Be sure to show your appreciation for someone's cooperation, and show your gratitude by doing something good for someone else.","interval":"2020w09","reqDate":"2020w09"}]}
