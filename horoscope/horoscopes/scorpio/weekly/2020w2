{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may be working at a very fast pace this week, Scorpio, and it may be a transition from something that was not concluded last week. You may be trying to catch up, but taking your time would be the best way to catch up, ironically. If you rush forward, you may miss a few issues that will need your attention later on, and then you will have to backtrack, which will take up even more of your time. So, slow down and get it right the first time. There could be a gain this week from something that has been in the works for quite some time. This may be a payoff you had not expected to come in just yet, but its appearance will be quite satisfying. There will be more positive results from this same venture, and this is just the beginning. It may be difficult, but you will have to remain very patient when a younger person comes to you with an explanation about why something went wrong. You may be irritated to be in this situation, but hearing this person out will be very important - not just for a better outcome, but also to continue on with a trusted relationship. If exhaustion begins to wear you down late in the week, you need to recognize it and take some time to decompress. Even taking an hour or so to close your eyes and meditate will put you in a better state of mind.","interval":"2020w02","reqDate":"2020w02"}]}
