{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You have arisen unshaken from a series of challenges, Capricorn. You have maintained your composure. You have stayed calm - and not just on the surface, but deep down too. You have been dignified and upbeat through it all, and it is about to pay off for you. You have passed a test - you have come to see that the small stuff life throws at you isn't worthy of drama or resentment in response. You have learned to face whatever you must, and do what you have to do. Your reward for this won't just be an imminent reward, but also a much more powerful way of dealing with life.","interval":"20191130","reqDate":"20191130"}]}
