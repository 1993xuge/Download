{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may start out this month feeling very ambitious, Pisces. But because you are sensitive to whatever is going on in the world around you, the stress and strife in the news and within the people in your group could be a bit of a downer. But you don't have to pay any attention to negative headlines or negative people. You have an uplifting spirit. You have the gift of being able to lift the hearts of others, and so you can certainly lift your own spirits if you try. Dwell on things that deeply matter to you this month, and work at happiness constantly. This will help you avoid any frightening topics that pop up in conversations that you overhear. Choose to be positive, and you will welcome positivity into your life. There may be several opportunities related to work or a dream this month. Although no one is going to hand you a wish-come-true on a silver platter, there is the possibility of great success right now if you are willing to work for it. While you may feel that you have already paid your dues in this area of your life, you are still in a learning and evolving process. Express gratitude to the universe for not just the blessings you receive this month, but also for the lessons you receive this month - even if they are challenging at times.","interval":"2020m04","reqDate":"2020m04"}]}
