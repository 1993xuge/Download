{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Don't you dare talk yourself out of a brilliant idea that comes to you early this week, Gemini. If you mull it over for too long without actually doing anything about it, you may start to pick it apart and criticize it, eventually deeming it too far out to try. But don't let its brilliance fizzle out. Take at least a step or two toward exploring what might be possible. Someone may try to engage you in a conversation this week that is well outside of your comfort zone. That may be because the emotions are way too deep or maybe it involves someone you both know personally, and you don't want to accidentally betray any confidences. If that's how you feel, then be direct in refusing to discuss the matter. Trusting someone who is new in your life may require a leap of faith. But if there is enough interest there, it will be well worth it. There is a way to do this without too much risk if you tread carefully and gather as much information as you can through observation and conversation. A certain hobby that you engage in from time to time has some very important built-in rewards simply because you enjoy what you are doing and because it may involve spending time with people you find to be fun. But there could be even more to this if you look at your hobby or interest in terms of making money this week. There may be a way to create a plan that allows you to blend business and pleasure.","interval":"2020w03","reqDate":"2020w03"}]}
