{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You need to march right into March with your head held high, hope in your heart, and a sense of humor within easy reach. This month could be a lot like a theatrical performance or a circus, depending on how you choose to see it and how you choose to deal with it. But really, Taurus, that could really be a good thing. You may experience a number of interesting characters and dramas, the chance to stand in the spotlight and accept accolades from those who admire you, and so much more, including poignant moments and romantic experiences to store in your memory for a rainy day. And that's another thing - there shouldn't be too many \"rainy days\" this month for you, metaphorically speaking. You may experience a long run of positivity and luck in the coming days and weeks, and that may include some positive financial news, an answer to a problem you have been grappling with, and the chance to mend a fence that broke down so long ago you may not even remember the storm that did the damage. You do need to keep in mind, once again, that you are in control of how this month plays out - good or bad. So, be ready to take on the best opportunities that come to you with vigor and joy. Be open to meeting new people - even if they don't seem like \"your type.\" Don't say no to chances to get out and about and to have fun. And even if you aren't in the mood to mix and mingle on certain days, be sure to use your time as productively as possible. This is a great time for inventing, imagining, and dreaming - so make the most of it.","interval":"2020m03","reqDate":"2020m03"}]}
