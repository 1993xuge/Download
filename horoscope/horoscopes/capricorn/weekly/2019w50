{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Your head may spend a lot of time in the clouds this week, Capricorn, but as long as you keep your feet firmly planted on the ground, you will be fine. You are far dreamier than you usually are, but that's a very good thing. Ideas are flowing through your brain like lightning strikes, and there are definitely at least a few really great ones to savor and explore. There may even be one that can help you accomplish one of your most important life missions, so don't waste any time putting your ideas into practical action. Don't be afraid to express how you really feel if someone asks for your opinion this week. You may feel stilted because you don't want to say anything that others see as unacceptable or politically incorrect. But you owe it to yourself to be true to your personal values. Doing so is never the wrong thing. There could be a disruption in your schedule this week that could send your best-laid plans flying sideways. But instead of letting this frustrate or irritate you, you need to flow with the change and find a way to make it work to your advantage. That's what winners like you do! A friend who seems to like to follow trouble may ask you along for an exciting excursion. It's up to you of course, but tagging along could bring a bit of trouble into your life too, so choose wisely. Later in the week, a chance encounter could lead to a new job or money-related opportunity.","interval":"2019w50","reqDate":"2019w50"}]}
