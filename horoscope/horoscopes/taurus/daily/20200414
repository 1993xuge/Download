{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Without a doubt, Taurus, you can be bull-headed at times. Well, let's be honest for a second - you tend to get bull-headed pretty often, especially when you are backed into a wall. Your stubbornness, however, can come in handy when you want to get a job done, but it can also get in the way of other things, such as your relationships. Today you need to recognize that you may be acting a bit too stubborn about something that could be affecting your happiness. If you could ease up just a little bit, and if you could be a bit more carefree, something in your life will immediately begin to go a whole lot smoother resulting in greater happiness. Don't get bull-headed on this too; just try it.","interval":"20200414","reqDate":"20200414"}]}
