{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may not see yourself as a chameleon, Pisces, but in some ways, you are. You are so highly empathic that you can pick up on the moods of the people around you, and you then start to take on those moods yourself. If someone is sad, for example, you start feeling forlorn. But even though others may not be as emphatic as you are, you can still have the same impact on others. Rather than picking up a sad mood today, you need to help someone else pick up your happy and vibrant mood.","interval":"20191227","reqDate":"20191227"}]}
