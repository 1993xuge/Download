{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Even though you may have a very long list of New Year's resolutions and things you want to do this year, Capricorn, there is no good reason to rush into anything. You are by nature a careful planner, but because you are also such a perfectionist, you may already feel far behind in beginning your quest to get so much done in the short space of a single year. But actually, the best way to set about accomplishing a long list of goals is to launch it with a good strategy and planning, so this is a great week to start thinking rather than doing. This is also a good week to get in touch with your domestic god or goddess and do something beautifully creative for yourself and perhaps for a special friend or two. Browse through cookbooks, come up with some interesting recipes, and plan a dinner that will tempt and tantalize. A good bottle of wine next to a crackling fireplace would be an appropriate combination for after-dinner conversation. An intense encounter around the middle of the week with a boss or a person in a position of authority may have you questioning a path you have chosen. But before you do anything hasty, you need to weigh the pros and cons and perhaps choose to see this path as a means to a very happy end that will come eventually. We sometimes have to pay our dues to get what we really want, and it is important to recognize that and take it in stride.","interval":"2020w03","reqDate":"2020w03"}]}
