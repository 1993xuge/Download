You are a unique individual, dear Libra, with your own needs, wants, and dreams. If you create your life around what works for someone else, you are not being true to who you are, or to your purpose. If you have been forming a plan, comparing an achievement of yours to someone else's, or modeling anything after someone else's values, then how can you be totally and fully happy? How can you ever reach your personal potential that way? Figure out what makes your heart feel good, and form your own path.","interval":"20200304","reqDate":"20200304"}]}
