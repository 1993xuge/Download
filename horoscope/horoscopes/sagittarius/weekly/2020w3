{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Someone may have the nerve to imply that you are a party pooper if you choose not to attend a social event or a gathering of friends or family this week, Sagittarius. What a nerve! You are usually the life of the party or the perfect host or hostess, so when you choose not to attend a social event, you probably have good reason. Don't be goaded or guilted into doing anything you don't want to do this week. You may have had enough of the parties and frivolity over the holiday season, and now it probably just feels like it's time to kick back and relax, and most likely that's exactly what you need - so heed that inner voice. A last-minute disappointment when someone bows out of a project or shows a lack of interest may force you to come up with an alternate plan. However, whatever you come up with this week could be far superior to what was already in place, so count this as a blessing in disguise. Have you been fantasizing about a cozy getaway with the one you love? If so, this is a great week to either start planning for or to simply escape to a hideaway where you can spend quiet moments with the one you love - in a quaint old hotel or a bed and breakfast. And, even if you are single, this is a great time to visit a similar charm-filled place on your own where you can while away the hours reading by a fireplace or hunting through quirky antique shops and flea markets. Why not?","interval":"2020w03","reqDate":"2020w03"}]}
