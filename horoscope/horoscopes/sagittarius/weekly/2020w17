{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may observe a certain situation unfolding in your life at a graceful, natural pace. This may be connected to something you see as your purpose in this life. Whether this relates to your career or something more deeply personal, Sagittarius, this week holds a blessing that will allow you to bloom bigger and brighter. Allow yourself to get caught up in the moment and experience it to the depth of your being, for this could change your path in beautiful and richly fulfilling ways. Talk of an exciting adventure you experienced in the past may have you thinking about the good old days. Although you cannot relive the past, you can relish those times for what they were and the blessings they brought into your life rather than regretting that they will never happen again. The future holds many possibilities. Don't limit yourself by coming up with reasons why you can't have as much fun in the future. Be open to what you can discover, and plan with that in mind. You may feel that you have gone as far as you can with a certain partnership, but an event that occurs this week could shed light on another mission that could be very exciting. Be open to opportunities that spring up from this.","interval":"2020w17","reqDate":"2020w17"}]}
