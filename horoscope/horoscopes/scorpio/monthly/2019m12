{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"A power struggle could ensue this month if you insist on doing something your way in a situation related to a family matter. And why shouldn't you, Scorpio? You have the right to insist on doing what works for you. But then again, you can be right or you can be happy - and your choice may come down to that. Do whatever will cause you the least angst and aggravation, for your peace of mind is the most valuable thing of all in this situation. A job offer, investment opportunity, or something else involving a change in the financial situation could boil down to a negotiation this month. While you may think you know all there is to know about this, you could really strengthen your argument and your leverage by seeking guidance from someone who can provide advice and possibly even mentor you in this area. Then you will have greater authority in any discussions. A new door could open related to an interest of yours. This may be something that started out as a hobby and quickly became a consuming passion. This may even translate one day into a money-making venture. It is said that if you love what you do, then it isn't work, and that philosophy may apply to this situation. If you continue to learn and grow, you could gain a sense of fulfilling your purpose and being all that you can be. The end of December would be a great time to take stock of where you are and where you go before venturing forth into the new year. Recognizing what you want will allow you to formulate a plan early for taking charge of your life in the year ahead.","interval":"2019m12","reqDate":"2019m12"}]}
