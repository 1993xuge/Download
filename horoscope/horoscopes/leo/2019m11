{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Your creativity and opportunities to show it off are in focus for you this month, Leo. You have some unique talents, and the way you present yourself is larger than life. When you choose to shine in the spotlight, there is no one who is more dazzling than you are. So, pour your all into an upcoming opportunity to show off your extraordinary talents, for there could be considerable benefits and gains available through this opportunity. If you do find yourself becoming nervous at all, just tap into your inner child and have fun with it. A social connection that becomes available to you this month may also have business possibilities. Someone you meet or an acquaintance you become closer to, could know people in the right places in some endeavor that you are interested in. Be sure to be upfront in your desires and your intentions to make the most of this. An interview or a presentation of some kind may catch you off guard by coming up at a seemingly inopportune moment, and you may be worried that you are not fully prepared as you prefer to be. However, if you just be your authentic self, your natural charisma will win the day. There may be a chance to heal an old rift that you had written off a long time ago. A chance encounter could open up that door. Go through that door, and you will find that it will bring a great level of relief. Even if you suspect this was arranged by someone, it is an excellent chance to start over again. Take it without hesitation.","interval":"2019m11","reqDate":"2019m11"}]}
