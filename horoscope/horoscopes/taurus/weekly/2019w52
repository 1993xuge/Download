{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You will be making slow and steady progress this week in all that you have to do including current obligations and any new endeavors you have taken on. Even so, there may be a continuous feeling that something is dragging you down. It isn't that you aren't getting enough done, Taurus; it's that you could get a lot more done with a lighter heart and greater flair. So, deal with whatever it is that has you feeling so bogged down, even if it means facing some awkward truths about a relationship or a commitment of some kind. Freeing yourself from this baggage will make you feel lighter and brighter. This is also a good week to remind yourself that you don't have to be crazy about someone to work well with them. You may be forced to team up with someone you don't get along with, or with whom conversation just does not flow easily. But if you can join forces for something that is bigger, then concentrating on that mission will help you flow past any differences you may have. A decision that has been iffy may finally be confirmed to your great relief. Even though this could give you a greater sense of self-assurance and security, don't take anything for granted, and don't lose sight of the importance of this and your reasons to be grateful. Challenge yourself each day to maintain the feeling that you are doing exactly what you are meant to be doing.","interval":"2019w52","reqDate":"2019w52"}]}
