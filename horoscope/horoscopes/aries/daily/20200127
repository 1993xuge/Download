{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Many people consider pampering themselves or relaxing as a luxury. They are all work and no play, and they don't dare even consider doing something for themselves unless and until everything else is taken care of. You tend to be one of those people, Aries - at least some of the time. If you are starting to feel as though your hard work is getting the best of you, it is time to slow down, at least for a little while.
