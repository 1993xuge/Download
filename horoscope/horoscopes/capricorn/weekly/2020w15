{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may finally find yourself free to move forward this week with something that has been in the planning stage for a long time. Even so, you may be hesitant to take those first steps. Perhaps you are afraid of failing after building this up in your mind, but you should have no fear of that. Just trust in your natural talent for strategy and take that first step forward. Once you do, you should find your confidence will build with each subsequent step you take. This is headed toward excellence and great reward. Someone who may be involved as a team member or in some other capacity in a project of yours may seem to believe that the rules don't apply to them. Since you are someone who may have designed the rules very carefully, you may see this as an affront to your leadership. But carry on anyway correcting at each step when someone steps out of line. Consistent attention to this, Capricorn, will solidify your role. Travel may be on your mind a lot now, and even though you may be anchored down by work and obligation, there is nothing to stop you from dreaming and planning for future travel. In fact, doing so might give you some wonderful moments of fantasy escape, which will fuel your desires further.","interval":"2020w15","reqDate":"2020w15"}]}
