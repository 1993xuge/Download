{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Being prepared is considered a virtue, and it is probably a virtue that you admire greatly, Virgo. You believe in knowing exactly what you are getting into, how to proceed, and what to expect. The predictability that comes with that kind of research and planning offers a lot of comfort, especially to someone like you who values the strength of a venture that is well-planned ahead of time. But every now and then it can be good to jump right into something without looking back. If you have a good feeling about something this month but you don't have the time to do your usual planning, then go with what you feel. It might turn out surprisingly well. If you find yourself feeling down or disappointed because you feel stuck, turn your thoughts to the future and think about how you can prepare yourself for it now. By starting to envision your ideas manifesting in your life in the very near future, you can go through the motions in your mind and prepare yourself for upcoming opportunities. Time is never lost when it is spent imagining and programming for happiness. A good deed you did for someone not so long ago may be on your mind. Perhaps the person who received the favor did not express their gratitude. And although you don't do good deeds to receive thanks, it is nice to feel recognized. You may receive recognition this month for your kindness, which should offer you sweet validation.","interval":"2020m04","reqDate":"2020m04"}]}
