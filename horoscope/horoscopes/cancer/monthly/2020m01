{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"This may be a month of negotiations, from small to large. And at least one of those exchanges might involve a frustrating matter where you were wronged. At first, it may seem like you will not prevail without an extreme step, such as taking legal action for example, but if you are smart and patient, you will see this work out. In all other matters, the same mindset should apply. A big project that has remained stagnant for quite some time might suddenly begin to get off the ground. Don't weigh this down with preconceived expectations, Moonchild, or you may hold it back. Just listen to your spirit, and it will guide the way. A transformation is possible for you with a leadership role. You may not have thought of yourself as the right person to fill this role, but as you take it on at some point this month, you should begin to see how well it suits you and how much talent you have for it. You may also be pleasantly surprised by how well people respond to you. This could be the beginning of a new interest for you. Although you may have made a list of things to do this year already, make sure these are not just about breaking old habits or getting chores involving drudgery accomplished. Be sure to put a few things on that list that inspire you, fill you with hope, and bring out your lust for life. In other words, plan on doing a few things that are just for you. You tend to put obligations and other people before yourself even when it isn't necessary, and that is something that has to change too.","interval":"2020m01","reqDate":"2020m01"}]}
