{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You have been holding back from telling someone how you really feel about a matter that has, perhaps, caused you a few sleepless nights. But this week, Pisces, you may feel bolder than ever and eager to hash out this issue. If you do bring this up, you should find the other party will be far more receptive to resolving it than they have been in the past. You may have gone beyond your limits financially on some big household or some other project recently, but you may have a chance to recoup something from that effort. This may come in the form of a small windfall or through some opportunity to catch up by taking on extra work. By the middle of the week, you may feel you really need a break from all of the obligations that keep piling up, and you should absolutely take that break. Keeping yourself mentally aligned and harmonious is extremely important to your well-being, and that aspect of your life should never be neglected. A wish you made a long time ago may show signs of coming true this week. Allow yourself to revel in that moment, to get excited, and to start imagining how wonderful it will be. You deserve it. A chance to make your life more stable may come to you this week in the form of a steadier flow of income, or through someone who wants to help you out in some way. This should be great news and something that will allow you to finally relax and feel that good things are meant to be and are headed your way.","interval":"2019w51","reqDate":"2019w51"}]}
