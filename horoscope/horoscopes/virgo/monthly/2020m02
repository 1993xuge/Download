{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"An authority figure that you had to answer to may slowly be losing their power, which could alter your role at work or in some situation that was unsatisfactory to you. This will be good news, Virgo, but don't gloat. Being considerate and compassionate is always the best way to go, and people may be watching for your reaction. Someone's anger has been simmering beneath the surface in recent weeks, and while this is not anger that is directed at you, it has had an impact on you in peripheral ways. You may be able to get down to the bottom of this early this month, which will not only lighten the mood, but will also make things much easier to endure. A friend may begin to play a much bigger role in your life this month. This could mean anything from a platonic connection taking a romantic turn, to choosing to partner up in business with someone who has been a friend for a long time. This can be a really good thing, but be sure to have everything spelled out very clearly to avoid any misunderstandings. Comments that come from someone you have trusted about someone else that you also like and admire may strike a painful blow. You may have had no idea this person felt this way, and you could feel taken aback. But this might just be a case of speaking without thinking, and it may not reflect this person's true feelings, so don't take it to heart. Another misunderstanding from several weeks ago may have a happy ending this month as you and another party agree to forgive and forget.","interval":"2020m02","reqDate":"2020m02"}]}
