This does not happen overnight, but it will definitely happen if one is committed to it. The same rule applies to learning something new. You will not become proficient overnight, but with steady, dedicated effort, you can eventually become quite skilled and knowledgeable. Just like exercising one's muscles in the gym makes that person stronger and fitter, exercising one's understanding and skills in a certain matter results in better control and understanding of this matter.
