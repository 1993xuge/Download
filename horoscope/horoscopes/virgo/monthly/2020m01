{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You should find that your family relationships are becoming increasingly warm and enjoyable this month, Virgo. Even those connections that were filled with friction should become easier and more enjoyable. Take note of the different way you react in these situations, and try to create a new way of relating. If you can do that, you can maintain the good connections and the stronger bonds that you are building. You may be seeking greater independence or perhaps more space from one particular relationship - perhaps a friendship or a romance that has become too cloying. This may be hard to achieve, as you may be dealing with someone who is rather manipulative. But if you stand your ground and make the demands that you need, you can modify this connection to be better and healthier. If you try to adopt a more spontaneous attitude toward life this month, you should find that more interesting opportunities will come to you. You are sometimes too reserved and too cautious, and because of this, you don't always attract the best chances. Those who know you may simply believe that you won't take a risk of any kind, but some risks can pay off quite well. If you choose to become involved in a partnership or a joint venture of some kind this month, be sure you make your requirements very clear upfront. This will help you avoid any misunderstandings and any trouble that could come from a lack of clarity.","interval":"2020m01","reqDate":"2020m01"}]}
