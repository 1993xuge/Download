{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may have heard the fable about a bet between the wind and the sun. The wind bet the sun that it could get a man to remove his coat faster. So, the wind blew fiercely trying to blow the coat off, but the man clung tightly to the coat. Then the sun came out and warmed everything up, and the man removed his coat. A warmer approach right now - rather than a harsh or forceful approach - will work best for you with something or someone you are trying to manage, Gemini. When you find yourself in such a situation - remember the sun's warm approach.","interval":"20200329","reqDate":"20200329"}]}
