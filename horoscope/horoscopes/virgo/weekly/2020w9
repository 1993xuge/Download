{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"There could be a major focus on your career this week, Virgo, or on something else that is especially important to you. You may have been wondering why this has not been more successful for you, especially since it seemed so very promising at first. But it could be that you have been scattering your energy and your attention, not focusing long enough on this one thing to take the important steps that are necessary. This week try to get down to business by concentrating on this as much as possible without any distractions. You can gain great momentum in this way. Your leadership may be called upon to help out with a matter associated with a legal issue or a negotiation, perhaps pertaining to a group of friends. Even though you may not have the expertise of the particular subject at hand, you will have enough objectivity to successfully guide others toward a meeting of the minds, so don't be afraid to try. Tough love may be needed this week for someone who keeps crossing over a boundary. You have been clear and assertive in conveying a message to someone, but they are not listening. This time, you have to stop worrying about offending this person or hurting their feelings, and let them know how their non-compliance is affecting you in a negative way. That should get your point across. An invitation that comes to you this week - perhaps later in the week - could involve someone with whom you are at odds with or estranged from. If you can find it in your heart, attend anyway, as this can start a reconciliation or plant the basis for the first steps towards reconciliation.","interval":"2020w09","reqDate":"2020w09"}]}
