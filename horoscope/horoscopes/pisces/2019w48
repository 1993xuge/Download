{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Have you ever paged through a yearbook from high school and wondered if people turned out the way you perceived them? Or have you simply wondered what they might be up to now? You may have the chance to catch up with someone from your childhood very soon, and this week there could be signs that this is to come because a name pops up in conversation or on social media. Someone you bonded with very quickly could soon evolve into a closer friend. This week, you may have the chance to get to know this individual much better, and you may find that this is a soulmate who understands you better than most. Your sensitivity will be celebrated in this relationship, so this is someone who will uplift you whenever you spend time together. Someone's delusions of grandeur may get on your last nerve this week, but try not to show it, Pisces. This person may brag about accomplishments and successes, but this may be coming from a deep sense of insecurity. Be compassionate, even if you are annoyed. By the weekend, a reward for a job well done may come to you unexpectedly. You may have thought that this would never occur, so savor the moment.","interval":"2019w48","reqDate":"2019w48"}]}
