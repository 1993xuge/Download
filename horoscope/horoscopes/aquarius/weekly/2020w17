{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may begin a new quest - perhaps at the urging of a friend or a family member - that will broaden your horizons in many ways. This is not something that is new to you, Aquarius, but someone may bring up a topic this week that encourages you to explore a concept or an idea that you have thought about for a long time. This could lead to a creative brainstorm and the inception of something very special in your life. Whether this is for personal fulfillment or is connected to a goal of making money, it can eventually become something that defines you on some level and helps bring out your greatest talents. If you are searching for insight and wisdom for some problem you are dealing with in your personal life - perhaps with a relationship - you may want to ask for advice from an older family member or a friend who has experienced something similar. Someone who has been there may have thoughts to share this week that can help you figure out the best approach to creating a positive outcome.","interval":"2020w17","reqDate":"2020w17"}]}
