You may have no further input, but you are probably hoping that it will turn out in the best way possible. You still may be concerned and wondering if it will turn out as a failure or whether it will manifest everything you have been hoping for.

But whatever happens, something good will come out of it in one way or another.","interval":"20200327","reqDate":"20200327"}]}
