{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may find that an obligation or a responsibility that you took on willingly in recent months has become too much for you. This week, it might hit a crescendo when there is even more to do than usual. If you feel the need to do something about this, Aquarius, this might be a good time to start creating a plan to either alter your responsibilities or get out of it altogether. Once you begin, you should have an innate sense of what to do and how to go about it. You may realize that something in your life is starting to feel \"stale.\" This may be anything from a job to a relationship, but it has begun to bore you. Does this mean you should start looking elsewhere for whatever it is that no longer pleases you? Not really. You should probably thoroughly assess what it is that has caused your change of heart, and take it from there. You may find that it is not the particular thing that you are concerned about, but rather your own state of mind that is causing you to see something that is essentially very positive in a negative way. You may find a lot of positive attention focused on you later this week. Your charm and charisma are particularly interesting to someone who values your intelligence and the way your mind works. This could turn out to be an interesting new friend, or even a love interest if you are single. Take baby steps, though, and learn as much as you can before getting too chummy.","interval":"2020w06","reqDate":"2020w06"}]}
