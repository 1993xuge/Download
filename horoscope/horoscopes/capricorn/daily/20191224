{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"As the season becomes increasingly more festive, and the end of the year draws near, we tend to put a lot of pressure on ourselves. We want to finalize as much as we can, and we want everyone to acknowledge and be happy with us. And most of all, we want to do all that perfectly. But by expecting someone else to give you that sense of acceptance, you are putting the power into someone else's hands, Capricorn. Don't give this power away. Don't allow someone else to define your values and dictate how you feel. Take back control of the way you see yourself and the way you define acceptance - because acceptance of yourself is what's most important. Don't forget that.","interval":"20191224","reqDate":"20191224"}]}
