{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"If you are under pressure to come up with a creative idea or with the solution to a problem this month and you are struggling to think of something really great and sufficient to impress someone you want to make a great impression on - brainstorming might be a good idea. The interaction alone will generate a back-and-forth that will generate an interesting line of thinking, and you can take it from there, Sagittarius. But don't let the pressure get to you - choose to have fun with it, and you will wind up doing your best work. A dramatic friend may be stirring up some controversy or commotion, and the stars are encouraging you to stay as far away from this as possible. Getting into anything that involves conflict or upheaval--even as a supporter or a contributor of advice - could wind up pulling you into the mess and creating further conflict. Let this person work it out on their own. If you are single, a blind date or just a regular date could turn out to be quite magical. Just be careful about falling in love too quickly. There may be some complexities here that you won't know about and won't be able to see right away. This could work out in the long run, but it will require time and patience. Attached Sagittarians could have a few very romantic moments this month and unique chances to escape together to someplace special, such as the place where you experienced your first kiss. You have spent a lot of time working on a big project, and you may want to reveal it this month. Not so fast. You may want to consider a few tweaks just to polish it off before your big debut.","interval":"2020m02","reqDate":"2020m02"}]}
