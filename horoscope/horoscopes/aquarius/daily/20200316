{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Intuition cannot be really measured. Even if someone has a highly developed sixth sense, they may not perform well under a pressurized testing situation. That's because it is a very sensitive gift - one that picks up vibrations that surround you. And that means, Aquarius, that you can't always fully trust your intuition if you are under a great deal of stress or suffering from unusual anxiety. If you have a bad feeling now, don't overreact to it. It is most likely a temporary state of stress rather than a real cause for worry.","interval":"20200316","reqDate":"20200316"}]}
