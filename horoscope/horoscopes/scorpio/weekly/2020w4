{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"A powerful change is now evolving in some area of your life that has remained stagnant for too long of a time, Scorpio. Whether this is your love life, your work life, or your friendships, you can probably already feel that change is in the air this week. Whatever was lacking will be replaced with exactly what you need, though this may be a slow and almost unnoticeable occurrence. Trust in the fact that things are getting better, and soon enough you will see progress as it begins to build momentum. This is a good week to begin evaluating whether there are any toxic associations in your life, either in relationships or with some obligation you have taken on that isn't truly yours. Although you may not want to make any actual changes now, you can begin to contemplate what to do and how to do it. This alone will lift your spirits and cause you to feel far more hopeful than you have for some time. A potential new friend could appear on your radar, and you may feel instant chemistry with this person. This could be someone who will fill a gap in your life that no one else could, and if that's the case, it would be a great connection. Through this person, or perhaps through a shared interest, you may meet additional people that you can relate to in a very positive way.","interval":"2020w04","reqDate":"2020w04"}]}
