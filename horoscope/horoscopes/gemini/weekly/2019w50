{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may discover this week that a comfortable routine has left you feeling a bit lazy and even apathetic. You always know what to expect in this area of your life, Gemini, and for you, that's a dangerous way to go. You are someone who is stimulated by chaos, inspired by challenges, and excited by change. You may need to break that routine and start shaking things up a bit. This will be a great way to stay more enthusiastic about the possibilities your life is offering right now. Appearances may be very deceiving this week when it comes to a new person at work or in your neighborhood. You may think you have this individual figured out perfectly, but don't count on it. If this is someone you have to work with or partner with in some way, be sure to get to know them before you get going so you know what to expect from them in terms of reliability and capability. Someone's unpolished approach to a shared venture may put you off a bit. Because of this, you may assume that this person is not skilled enough or sophisticated enough to pull off whatever you are working on. Don't make that assumption. You may find that this person has great expertise and a natural flair for your shared venture, so relax and let it flow. A message you receive this week through an overheard conversation, a song, or in some other odd way could be deeply meaningful to a current decision you are mulling over. Consider it carefully, for the answer is there.","interval":"2019w50","reqDate":"2019w50"}]}
