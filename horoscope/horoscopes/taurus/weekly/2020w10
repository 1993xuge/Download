{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may not feel like embracing a new person in your life this week, dear Taurus, because you just don't feel like you are on the same wavelength. It may not be about anything this person has done or said or their background or anything unlikeable about them. It may almost seem like there is a risk of being vulnerable with this particular individual. But do you know what that means? It means that this may be someone who could become very special to you, and that could be frightening. You may worry about not making the right impression or of being rejected or many other things like that. But you may find that if this is truly a kindred spirit connection, there will be nothing like that at all to worry about. You may find yourself at the center stage where a group activity is concerned this week. You probably won't volunteer, but you may be pushed into the spotlight by people who believe in you. Use your humor to get through this. You aren't someone who gravitates to the spotlight, but relax and make the best of it, and you may wind up enjoying yourself. Someone you may meet soon who is viewed as a philosopher of sorts - perhaps someone in an ordinary profession such as bookselling, bartending, and so on - may offer you some insight into something that has puzzled you for a long time. Take wisdom where you find it and be grateful for it. It could offer a solution to an important problem.","interval":"2020w10","reqDate":"2020w10"}]}
