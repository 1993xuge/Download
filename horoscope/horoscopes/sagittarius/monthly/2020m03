{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You are certainly an adventurer by nature, Sagittarius, but in recent weeks, you may have been feeling a bit claustrophobic. You may have been tethered by job commitments, family obligations, and just day-to-day obligations that have left little time for having fun or setting off on one of your adventures. The month may open up that way for you, but you should find that assistance comes seemingly out of nowhere to help you accomplish much of what you have to do, freeing up your schedule to allow you more time to play and explore. Use your free time wisely with careful planning so that you can do everything that you want to do to satisfy your adventurous spirit. Because of your innate sense of independence, you don't like to ask for help very often. But you may wind up working on something this month that is big and complicated, and asking for help would be a good way to get the assistance you need. This does not mean that you have to lose control of what you are doing. You can still manage your goals if you look at this as a team effort and choose someone who complements your talents and skills. Since getting it done is most important, this could be a great means to an end. Communication with someone you ordinarily see as a kindred spirit could be a bit strained this month, but that may be because of some unresolved conflict. Neither of you wants to bring it up, but opening it up to the light of day is the only way to resolve it. Work up your nerve and allow yourself to share how you are feeling, and share your hopes of getting back into your groove.","interval":"2020m03","reqDate":"2020m03"}]}
