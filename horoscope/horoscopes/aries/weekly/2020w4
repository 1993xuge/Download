{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"This week may be all about relationships for you, Aries. That could mean not just romantic connections, but also associations with family, friendships, workmates, and other people who may populate your life on a routine basis. It may seem as though there are things that you need to work out with several people in your life, and this will force you to deal with some issues that you have let slip for some time. But once you actually face and deal with these outstanding matters, it will seem like a huge weight has been lifted from your shoulders. The end of a problem you have struggled with for quite some time could occur this week. Although this may come as a surprise, it will be a huge relief and possibly an unexpected blessing that it will end so well. The end of this problem may even occur on its own, without you having to take any measures to free yourself whatsoever. Your emotions may rise to the surface regarding a goal that left you frustrated and for which your path always seems to be blocked. But when you finally are able to show the depth of your passion for this venture, some door that has been closed to you will open up, providing you with access to the help and guidance you need to get this done. A home-related matter may surface this week, even though you thought this was something that you had already taken care of. But dealing with this immediately is advised so that you can check this off your list for good.","interval":"2020w04","reqDate":"2020w04"}]}
