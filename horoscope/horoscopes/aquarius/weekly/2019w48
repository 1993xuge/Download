{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Try not to mix friendship with finance this week, Aquarius. That could cover anything from not turning to a friend for financial advice, to not lending or borrowing money from a friend, or even becoming partners in a venture that involves investing. That's not a forever thing, but right now this is not the time to launch an effort of this kind. You can explore the possibilities of course, but you need to wait it out before beginning. You may be creating a plan now without being as realistic as you could be and should be. You want to feel like the sky is the limit, but you may have to reel it in a bit. Work with the resources you actually have - not the resources you wish you had. Limiting yourself in this way will actually help you and inspire you to be more imaginative and creative. A timeline you had planned on for a trip or an adventure of some sort may not be working out. This may involve another party who would be sharing the experience with you. But you should find that this is a blessing in disguise because you may get more of your desire because of this change, so be happy about it.","interval":"2019w48","reqDate":"2019w48"}]}
