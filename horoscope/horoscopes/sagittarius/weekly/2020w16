{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You prefer to approach new ventures from a very grounded mindset. You don't like to get carried away by possibilities or hypotheses, Sagittarius. You usually require proof to invest your time or other resources into something new. But this week, you may hear of something that could be slightly risky but holds quite a lot of appeal for you. You may not have the luxury of exploring this fully before becoming involved, so in this case, you will just have to blend your intuition with educated guesses. You will make the right decision, so be confident in whatever you choose to do. You may have wondered for a long time now where you stand with a matter connected to romance, work, or your role in a partnership of some kind. This week, you may receive important feedback that will tell you exactly where you stand, and this should be quite positive. You may have undervalued your contribution, and validation is on the way. However, you must pay attention to any feedback you receive, for it will be instrumental in reinforcing an essential aspect of your life.","interval":"2020w16","reqDate":"2020w16"}]}
