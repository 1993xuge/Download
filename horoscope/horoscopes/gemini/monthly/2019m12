{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Trouble in a relationship that began fairly recently may come front and center in December, Gemini. You may find that you can no longer brush this aside, make excuses for it, or ignore it any longer. This means you will have to deal with it face to face. But this is a good thing because it will finally bring certain problems out into the open where they can be peacefully resolved - getting you back on track with someone you love. You may have the urge to make a life-changing decision this month, one that will have you embarking on a new and exciting phase of your life. Although this is a good time to consider all of your options and to learn as much as possible, making a big move or a serious commitment now could be a mistake. This is something that needs to \"ferment\" until you can see the fullness of it and decide whether it is right for you or not. A major breakthrough in a job, a money matter, or a legal matter may occur for you this month. While this may not end as you expected it would, it will still bring the same great sense of relief, as if a weight has fallen away from your shoulders. You should apply what you have learned through this experience so that you can avoid it in the future. Someone may come to you this month attempting to justify a wrong they did that affected you. But don't take this as an excuse because it might just be this person's way of easing into an apology. And right now, an apology would be just the thing you need to make you feel validated. Try to be understanding and see where it leads.","interval":"2019m12","reqDate":"2019m12"}]}
