{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You have a persuasive kind of charm, Pisces. You can give a look, say something that expresses your desires in a most creative way, and talk a friend or an admirer into anything. With the lovely pictures you paint with your colorful imagination, you can be very convincing. This month, this talent will come in handy. Like many people, you probably have a list of goals and desires for the year ahead, and there may be one right off the bat that you want to get started with. By turning on that legendary charm, you can find an accomplice who will enjoy the experience as much as you do, and you might even successfully pull it off before the month is over. With an important relationship - one that you see as central in your life - you may discover this month that you have very different ideas about where a certain issue should go or how it should be handled, even though you probably thought you were on the same page. If you are both stubborn, it will be difficult to work out. But if you are willing to compromise, you can both get most of what you want. In an effort to escape the January doldrums, you might want to take off on an adventure, and you may find the perfect companion to do just that. The only problem may be that you tend to get into trouble with that person, so make sure your adventure is fully enjoyable by not going overboard. Stay within the boundaries you draw beforehand, and you will be fine.","interval":"2020m01","reqDate":"2020m01"}]}
