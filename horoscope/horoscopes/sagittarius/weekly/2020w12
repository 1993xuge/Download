{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"As the week begins, Sagittarius, you may feel very much like a butterfly emerging from its cocoon. You have been hibernating, in a sense, for the last few weeks or maybe even longer than that. During that time, you have kept more to yourself or spent your time with cherished friends and family members. But at the same time, you have been evolving spiritually and creatively, and now you feel ready to fly. There are ideas and goals you have been formulating that will begin to crystalize for you this week. And as they do, remember that you are capable of soaring as high as you want to. You may even meet someone special this week who can help you take some of your ideas to higher levels. Your wings are strong, so trust in them. Although you can be a very practical person, this week you may have the urge to indulge or to spend too much. But you are someone who works hard, so if there is something very special in your sights, then go for it if you can. You need to reward yourself now and then for your diligence and hard work. Always an adventurer, your recent period of stillness may have left you feeling the urge to go out and explore, and this week is a great time to start looking into what you want to do. Whether this takes the form of travel, learning, or starting some new endeavor, enjoy the time you spend learning about it and considering the possibilities.","interval":"2020w12","reqDate":"2020w12"}]}
