{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"A philosophical debate this month with someone you don't ordinarily see eye-to-eye with could show you another side to this person. In discussing a matter you didn't think you would agree on, Pisces, you may see the depth of this person's compassion and their sharp intellect as well. Let this be the start of a closer relationship, for this is someone who may be a kindred spirit. And just think, you might not have known if not for a difficult conversation. You should soon get an answer to a question that someone has been avoiding. At various times, they may have put you off, changed the subject, or simply refused to answer. But suddenly it may seem as though the floodgates have opened, and you may receive even more information than you asked for. You may have to make an impromptu trip this month, and although it may have been unplanned, it could turn out remarkably well. Don't worry about how it will go, just think positive thoughts and positive events will follow. The chance to learn a new skill or to perfect a hobby may come to you this month. Although this might put a crimp in your schedule and be rather inconvenient, it is something you should do if at all possible. In fact, this is something you need to do for your inner harmony and well-being. Personal pursuits are just as important as earning money and all of your daily obligations. You owe this to yourself.","interval":"2020m02","reqDate":"2020m02"}]}
