{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may hope to stay out of the spotlight and fly under the radar as much as you can this week, Libra, but that may not be possible. You may wind up in a high-profile role at work or with a project that centers around your neighborhood or a group of friends. Your particular expertise in an important area may require you to stand front and center. And while this may seem like a big burden that you don't need right now, if you lighten up, you might actually enjoy it. Your natural talent for communicating in a very balanced and fair way may help out a friend this week who has an important message to communicate. With your guidance, you can help someone say just the right thing in an equitable way that will be greatly appreciated. A frustrating situation could evolve when you are called upon to straighten out a problem that stems from a misunderstanding. Keep your cool because without a level head, it will be difficult to figure out the mixed signals. This should be simple to straighten out if you listen carefully to everyone who's involved. If you have been thinking about taking on a part-time job or doing something else to bring in an additional flow of income, you may have some luck this week in finding just the perfect fit.","interval":"2020w02","reqDate":"2020w02"}]}
