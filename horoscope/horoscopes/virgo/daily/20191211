For example - you would not want to read an important document in a dimly lit room. You would strain your eyes and you might miss some very important points. But too much glaring light can also make it difficult to clearly see what you are doing. Seek the right conditions and the right advice. You may be studying something important now by looking at it far too intensely and analyzing and weighing every single word. Too much of that could be confusing. An objective party may be able to help you work through this, Virgo.","interval":"20191211","reqDate":"20191211"}]}
