{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"There could be a focus on the family for you this week, Capricorn. If you aren't getting along with one family member in particular, you may find yourself sorting through what went wrong and how it happened, and although you would like to resolve the issue, you may not know how best to approach this. You could seek out professional guidance, or you might just consider penning a heartfelt letter expressing how you feel and what you envision for the future. Sharing that you feel hopeful that the issue can be resolved could be met with confirmation that it can. Although it might take some time to work this out completely, there is a lot of hope for a much stronger relationship. Your level-headed way of thinking, your practical approach to life, and your general likeability - all of these qualities contribute to making you a good leader. This week, you may have the chance to stand in a leadership role for someone else. This could be a great chance to prove your mettle and to draw in other, more permanent opportunities for leadership positions. You may find that when others in this situation turn to you for advice, it comes quite naturally to you. If you are involved in a group effort, your role may become more important this week because you will have the ability to help others understand a complex subject. Your down-to-earth way of teaching puts others at ease and makes it easy for them to ask questions and to try new things.","interval":"2020w07","reqDate":"2020w07"}]}
