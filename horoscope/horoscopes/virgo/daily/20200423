We may even pay closer attention to gossip than we normally would. Doing so can make us feel that maybe there are bigger problems than those we are facing personally. But there may be a lot of stories circulating around you now - as communication is heightened for you - but that does not mean that it is all accurate. Take each item you hear with a grain of salt. Focus more positively on your own challenges, and don't be lured away by chatter coming from elsewhere.","interval":"20200423","reqDate":"20200423"}]}
