{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Although you may have the deep desire to please someone you admire and want to impress, going too far and taking on too much this week is not advised. There is such a thing as going too far, especially when your self-esteem is involved. If you think that showing someone how wonderful you are may be based in personal insecurity, then you need to work on building up your confidence in yourself, rather than on impressing someone else. Maybe that is something you could work on this week. Someone who has let you down in the past may show up this week looking for another chance. You can be tough on those who don't fulfill their promises, Sagittarius, and you may be wondering why you should give someone another chance to let you down. But if there were complicating factors, it might be wise to accept an apology and give someone the benefit of the doubt. Even if you are wrong, you will know that you did the right thing, and you will also have learned something about this person's character which will be valuable to you in the future.","interval":"2020w13","reqDate":"2020w13"}]}
