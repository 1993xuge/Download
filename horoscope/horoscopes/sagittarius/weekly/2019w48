{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You have a whirlwind week coming up, Sagittarius. You may want to start out with a relaxing meditation session, a soothing facial, or a nice massage to prepare you for the vigorous days ahead. Don't let that scare you though - this is all good. You should be very active because there should be many wonderful opportunities available to you. You may even find that a treasured goal can finally be launched this week as the elements you need begin to fall into place for you. You should take your time this week analyzing a choice you are about to make. You want to make sure that you are making this choice because it is best for you, rather than being influenced by what someone else believes to be right for you - only you know. You may be worried about a recent change you made, but the universe is protecting you from any unwanted consequences. You did what you believed was the right thing to do, and you were right. That will be validated soon - perhaps by the end of the week. Someone may try to make an unfair demand from you by the weekend, but you need to stand up for yourself if that happens. No one can push you around if you don't allow it.","interval":"2019w48","reqDate":"2019w48"}]}
