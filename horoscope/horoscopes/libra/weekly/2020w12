{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may have the chance to let go of some baggage this week that you have been carrying around for a long time, Libra. You may have thought that you would never be able to let this go, so you may have resigned yourself to carrying it around forever. But when something seemingly random occurs, it will provide the insight you never experienced before and will shed light on this from a wise perspective. Be grateful. A project you became involved in thinking that it would be a pretty tame experience may turn out to be more like a three-ring circus this week, and you may feel like your role is that of ringmaster. However, if this is too much for you, remember that you are not obligated to lead this craziness. Just do your part the best you can, and things should settle down rather quickly. Your generosity toward someone long ago may be recognized after a very long time at some point this week. You may not have realized how great an impact you had, but it was considerable. This may even lead to something you had not expected. You may discover common ground this week with someone you consider to be your polar opposite. This should be a very pleasant discovery, for it will mean that any time you spend together in the future has the potential to be marked by shared joy. This is something to be mindful of any time you meet someone who seems very different from you.","interval":"2020w12","reqDate":"2020w12"}]}
