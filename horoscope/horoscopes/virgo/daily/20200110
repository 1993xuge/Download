Just a word or even a look to this person that expressed that you were down, and you would be the recipient of inspiring messages and encouragement. If that person is no longer in your life, reach out and reconnect since you can provide each other with wonderful support. If that's not possible, find that same inspiration in something else that you love - such as art or music. You are in need of a muse now, Virgo, and you will find the inspiration you need if you just look around.","interval":"20200110","reqDate":"20200110"}]}
