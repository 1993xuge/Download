{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You are a very strong-willed person, Sagittarius, but your practical nature sometimes limits you. For example, when you send a wish out into the universe, you may not always ask for exactly what you want, but something close to what you want, or something that is simply acceptable. You may not go all out and express what you truly want because you may fear it won't be possible. But the requests you send out into the world should come from the heart and not be limited by fear. Ask for what you want now. You have an excellent chance of getting it.","interval":"20200221","reqDate":"20200221"}]}
