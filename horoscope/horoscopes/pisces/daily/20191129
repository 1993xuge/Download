{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"As a tree grows, its roots reach out in all directions, and they grow deeper and deeper into the earth. When a tree is well-rooted, it holds a more secure place because it clings to the earth more powerfully, which protects it from being uprooted during high winds or a storm, and it provides more water and nutrients for the tree to feed on. Right now, Pisces, you need to emulate the tree with an important task or adventure. Set down roots by establishing relationships with people who can guide you and connect you with the resources you need. That kind of security will give you the confidence you need to succeed.","interval":"20191129","reqDate":"20191129"}]}
