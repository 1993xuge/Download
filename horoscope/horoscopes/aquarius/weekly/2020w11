{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"It's all about me, me, me! Does this describe someone in your life who has a rather childish demeanor and outspoken self-centeredness about them? If so, Aquarius, it doesn't matter whether this person is older or younger, they probably aren't going to change. That's why it is up to you to ignore any theatrics that play out this week, especially if you don't have the proper time to deal with them. This person's drama may be amusing at times, but this week could hold some pretty important moments for you, and wasting your time on consoling and deflecting an approach like this could throw you off track. Think about yourself for a change. A money matter may take up a lot of your time this week. It may not be about a mistake, per se, but more about reevaluating an investment. Don't rush yourself to make any decisions. Come up with some ideas, then live with them for a while before you take any steps or make any commitments. New seeds in your professional life or with some hobby or aspiration you have spent a lot of time working on could begin to flourish. The timing is perfect because this could align you with people who can help you get a big idea off the ground. Be aware and open to meeting anyone this week who can help you to further this dream. A door is opening! With the right guidance and the right connections, this could be really good for you.","interval":"2020w11","reqDate":"2020w11"}]}
