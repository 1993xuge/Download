{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may be searching for an answer by seeking feedback from friends and family, and maybe even strangers. But this is a question that only you can answer, Libra, for you are the one who will have to live with the outcome. But there are so many positives here that you may not be seeing, and this week they will start to become more apparent to you. Pay attention to the hopeful messages you receive wherever you look, and the answer you need will become more and more obvious. You may have taken a certain argument to its limit. You may have been trying to convince someone to align with you on a matter where you feel like you are standing alone. But the only way to truly prove your point is to demonstrate it. A practical approach - showing rather than telling - is what might be called for in this situation. This week, you should have a chance to demonstrate what you want someone to believe - and they will believe in you if you give them that chance. Later in the week, you need to aim high when a window of opportunity opens for you. Don't underestimate what you are capable of. If you can dream it and you persevere, you will find your way through that window and on to success.","interval":"2020w17","reqDate":"2020w17"}]}
