{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You could receive good news this week for which you have waited for quite some time. This news may bring a great sense of relief and validation. This week could also hold a surprise with a family issue, and it could bring to a close an ongoing argument with a surprising twist. If you have something important on your mind, Leo, or a big presentation to make, this is a great week to say what you have to say. Your communication skills should be enhanced, and your thought process should be clear and energized - just make sure you get enough rest and sleep to keep your mind razor-sharp. Speaking up now will mean you can get your points across with power and passion, and you will be very convincing, winning over your audience. If someone turns to you with a personal problem this week, be extra careful about giving out advice. You may not fully understand this person's dilemma, and giving out guidance could result in a misunderstanding. Wait until you have heard it all, and do some research on your own if you really want to help. Someone's irreverent comment could come across as insulting this week, even if it was not intended to be that way. If this is bothering you, then reach out and ask directly. Clarifying this will be important to your peace of mind.","interval":"2020w02","reqDate":"2020w02"}]}
