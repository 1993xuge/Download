{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Your focus this week should be on your own well-being, Virgo. You may be more concerned about someone else right now than you are about yourself, but you should find that if you take care of yourself, you will also be able to take care of that other person who may be worried about you. You are ambitious and steady in your approach to financial matters, and you may sometimes become obsessed with projects that frustrate you. You strive to get things under control because disorder nags at you. However, the more you relax and the more centered you feel, the easier it will be to maintain serenity and contentment in all matters, both business and personal. Go easy on yourself with a matter that has not been working out according to a plan. Taking a strong action on this now could backfire. Instead, get into the right frame of mind by spending time this week just thinking about it positively and hopefully. Once you get to a place where you feel more positive about it, you should see it turn around and begin to work out. The stars may put someone in your path this week who will be really good for you on a personal level. This person can bring some much-needed inspiration to an area of your life where that has been lacking lately.","interval":"2020w15","reqDate":"2020w15"}]}
