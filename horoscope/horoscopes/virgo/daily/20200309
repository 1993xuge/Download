That kind of a sudden, unexpected slip leaves you with little time to react. But once it happens you know better, and you will probably be more cautious when you leave the house on a cold day the next time. You may have slipped recently in a conversation. It may have happened because you were feeling anxious or nervous. Don't feel guilty, Virgo, because it happens to the best of us. Just be extra careful in similar upcoming social situations so that you don't slip and say something you want to remain private.","interval":"20200309","reqDate":"20200309"}]}
