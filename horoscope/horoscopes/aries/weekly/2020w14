{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may meet many people this week that you don't agree with, and that don't agree with you! That may be an obvious observation to you, Aries, but it is one that needs to be front and center so that you handle it in a way that works well for you. You have a strong personality. When others are not on the same team or the same page as you, you have a need to set them straight. That won't work this week. Right now, a peaceful harmony with others is what you need to cultivate inner harmony. It is more than agreeing to disagree; it is about not addressing it at all, so don't go there if you know there may be conflict. There are more important things for you to do. And this week, there will be a few wonderful opportunities to engage with others with similar interests, and you may have the chance to learn something about one hobby or side business that you are passionate about. You may also be able to finalize a deal or a negotiation about something that has big potential for you financially.","interval":"2020w14","reqDate":"2020w14"}]}
