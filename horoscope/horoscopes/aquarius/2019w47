{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Just because a new assignment or venture brings you a lot of extra responsibility, does not mean that it must also bring a lot of added stress and frustration, Aquarius. You may be worried about a new obligation, but if you enter this week without fear or preconceived ideas, you may find that this is something that you actually enjoy, and rather than feeling like a lot of extra work, it is more like a lot of extra fun. Be open-minded about it. You are an emotionally strong person, and you are often a voice and a source of strength for the underdog. This week, you may have the chance to stand up for someone who is in need of your assistance, or you may give hope when it is needed most. Take pride in this, because not just anyone can help out in the unique way that you can. A current endeavor may be stalled or in a state of flux this week, but don't worry about that. This is not the end or a sign of trouble. If you relax and just let it unfold, you should find that the pace will pick up again soon, and all will be even better than it was before. You may feel the need for more support within a close relationship. If you voice how you feel this week, you should be met with warmth and love. You may not have been communicating your needs, but once you do, you should find the haven you seek.","interval":"2019w47","reqDate":"2019w47"}]}
