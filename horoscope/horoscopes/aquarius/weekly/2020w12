{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Your week may start out in a very routine and predictable way, Aquarius, but from there it may go a bit haywire - but in a good way! Stirring up excitement may not be what you had in mind, but something you choose to do or say could rile someone up considerably. But don't worry about that. Once someone acclimates to an announcement or an opinion you share, they will warm up to the idea and eventually realize that it is the best call. There may be some questions about what you will do in the future as far as a relationship or your career is concerned. But oddly, the answer may come to you from out of the blue when you are least expecting it. Something you hear or experience this week could shed light on some aspect of your thoughts that provides an immediate answer, and you should feel confident that it is the best route to take. A long-sought victory connected to your rights or getting credit for something you achieved could come this week, or you may learn of it in the days ahead. This should be very fulfilling and satisfying to you, and you may have the chance to say \"I told you so\" to someone, but please resist. Let it be enough that you are a winner. A cautious approach to a new goal is the best approach. You may be thinking about starting something new in the area of work or learning, but you may find that it isn't precisely going to meet your needs. Do some exploring before you agree to or start anything.","interval":"2020w12","reqDate":"2020w12"}]}
