{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Things may be moving very slowly for you now, Libra. This is probably very frustrating for you because you really need things to move quicker. But it is unproductive to think of this as the time when you are falling behind. That's a waste of your time since thinking about it will not help in any way to move things quicker and will just add to the frustration. Try to see this as an opportunity for you to reflect, review, rest and maybe meditate. This will not only turn your attitude around, but it will also draw in good vibrations and positive energy.","interval":"20191201","reqDate":"20191201"}]}
