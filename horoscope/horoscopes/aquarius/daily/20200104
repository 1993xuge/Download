{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Happiness is not always dramatic. In fact, at times it is rather understated. It comes in moments and in memorable experiences. It can come through the people that you love and the things that you love to do. Recognizing happiness is important though. It should settle into you like a peaceful sense of harmony. But if you don't acknowledge it, it doesn't have a profound impact. Start paying more attention to those special moments that bring you happiness, Aquarius. There are many every single day. All you need to do is learn to see and appreciate them.","interval":"20200104","reqDate":"20200104"}]}
