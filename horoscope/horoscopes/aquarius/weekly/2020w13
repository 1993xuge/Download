{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"The things that we hope to change in life but cannot change can change us. Something you have been trying to manifest in your life has not worked at all, Aquarius. This can change you, but only you can ultimately decide how it will change you. It can make you resentful, regretful, and angry. It can stay with you like a scar. Or, it can elevate you, make you more flexible, and it can help you see the wonders of your life and why this change was a blessing in disguise, making you even grateful for that experience. This week when you run into such troubles - make the obvious choice. If you have ever run into someone you know in childhood, you may see a lot of differences, but people essentially maintain their character. Someone you may encounter this week or very soon may seem to have changed a lot, and that may make you wonder if you still have enough in common. But if this person is still essentially the one you rightly admired, then it can add depth and dimension to your life to include them among your friends.","interval":"2020w13","reqDate":"2020w13"}]}
