{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"A big plan or strategy you created may have to be adjusted this month. While this may come as a surprise, Capricorn, and it may be frustrating to say the least, you should find that making a few small changes will improve things dramatically. Don't waste time on resentment or complaining, just assume that the changes can take you even farther than you anticipated. You may receive some wonderful flattery from someone you see as a mentor or a leader, and it is well-deserved. Don't start doubting what you hear or assuming that you just got lucky. Work on acknowledging your talents and believing when someone believes in you. We are already in the second month of the year, and you may be angry at yourself for not working on a certain important resolution made at the start of the year. Well, it isn't too late! Make a point each day this month to take one small step to make this happen, and by the end of the month, you should experience a true sense of accomplishment. If you have been hoping for a raise at work or an increase in income through some outside source, it could become possible for you this month. This increase should build confidence and make you feel more secure in your life in general. You may find closure this month with a relationship that became estranged some time ago, maybe even in the more distant past.","interval":"2020m02","reqDate":"2020m02"}]}
