{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may feel in an especially assertive state of mind this week, and for you that's really saying something. But there is one difference here - your assertiveness now may be in an area that you have formerly been rather reticent to express, and so this is a good development. Just be sure to think things through very thoroughly before you speak up. As long as you gather your thoughts and ideas into an organized framework, you can accomplish what you set out to do. You could find yourself in a battle of wills with someone important in your life this week as well. This may be someone that you clash with frequently, but when the two of you are aligned, there is no greater, more powerful force. So, instead of fighting against this person to get something that you want, try teaming up with a shared goal. Mutual respect and collaboration will take you far. Although you may have been nurturing the idea of a new venture, this is not a great time to start. Instead, try spending any extra time you may have this week to create a workable plan, and start reaching out to others who can help you with guidance and resources. You may have to learn something this week - such as a new skill for your work, or you may need to put something together at home - and this could be somewhat challenging. But if you let frustration get the better of you, it will be even more difficult. Just take your time and be very patient with yourself, and things will work out much better.","interval":"2020w02","reqDate":"2020w02"}]}
