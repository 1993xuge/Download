{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Making a wrong choice is not a sign that someone is foolish or stupid. Even making several wrong choices in succession is not necessarily proof of that, Taurus. You may be making an assessment of someone based on their mistakes or their failures, but you need to see the bigger picture before you have a true understanding of this person - or of anyone. You can be quite a perfectionist in your ways, but surely even you make mistakes and bad choices from time to time. Give someone a chance today, and you may discover there is quite a lot to admire about them.","interval":"20200307","reqDate":"20200307"}]}
