{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You can certainly choose to tell the truth about how you are feeling if a conflict with a friend comes up this week. You may feel like you have been walking on eggshells around this person, dear Taurus, and you may be good and tired of it. The desire to shout out your complaints may come to you naturally. But before you say what you are feeling without sugarcoating it, make sure you are okay with the possible outcome. This could be a healthy thing to do, but you do need to be prepared for the consequence. This week will be considerably more upbeat by mid-week when social opportunities you have been hoping for pop up. If you start to wrap each task up as soon as possible early in the week, you will have plenty of time to engage in socializing. So, plan ahead. Later in the week, you may choose to revisit a moment in time that holds a special memory for you. Doing this can help you get back in touch with the inspiration that came from that moment, and it could reignite a plan that has been dormant for a long while.","interval":"2019w47","reqDate":"2019w47"}]}
