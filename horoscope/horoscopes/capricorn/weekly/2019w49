{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"A burst of energy at the beginning of the week could put you in the mood for a bit of spring cleaning and organizing, even though it isn't spring. Your natural desire to straighten out and organize your environment may take over, causing you to get your home space in order. Doing this now will give you a lift and make you feel on top of things. This is also a great week to initiate an exercise routine if that is something you have been thinking about. Starting out with this when you are feeling energized will allow you to start with vigor and enthusiasm, which will carry through to your future workouts because you are establishing a pattern. If you don't properly channel your restless energy this week, it could result in making mistakes or poor decisions, so be aware of that and concentrate on what is best for you, Capricorn. A casual or spontaneous conversation could bring insight into an old and established relationship, which could explain some behaviors that have always baffled you. This could help you grow closer to this person, even if you have already known them for a very long time. Be wary about making any big purchases this week, for you may find a way to save if you are careful in this decision. Don't rush in spontaneously or impulsively, or you might regret your choice. Have patience.","interval":"2019w49","reqDate":"2019w49"}]}
