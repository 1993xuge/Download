Because of this, some who don't fully understand you may not always take you seriously because your dreams tend to be so big and seemingly out of reach at times. But what they do not understand is that you are also a realist, and when you dream, you are capable of finding a rational path to get what you want. So, dismiss all those who don't believe in you and your dreams, and keep dreaming and working toward your goal. It is certainly nice to have support and backing, but a sure way to know that your ideas are innovative and disruptive is if others find it hard to believe in them.","interval":"20191226","reqDate":"20191226"}]}
