{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"If you do your best to make the most of a situation that is not ideal and not as you envisioned it to be but has potential, you should see an improvement almost immediately. Once you just accept that you are not in charge of how things turn out, Libra, things will play out naturally, and you should be quite happy with the outcome. You may have words with someone this week over a conflicted point of view, but if you allow it to escalate; it will only get worse. Instead, try to see the other party's side of it, and you may wind up agreeing more than you thought with their perspective. If you find yourself dealing with a disagreeable person later in the week, try to respond with patience and kindness. This may come as a surprise to the individual since most people would probably become defensive. But you can handle this best with a gentle touch. Romance could come calling for you this week as well, and it will be a most welcome feeling. A moment of romance and mystery could awaken feelings in you that were long forgotten and stir up passions that have remained dormant for some time. Savor the experience.","interval":"2019w47","reqDate":"2019w47"}]}
