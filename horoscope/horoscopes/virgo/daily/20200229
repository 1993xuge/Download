Another touch here, one alteration there, and on and on until the artist becomes so lost in striving for perfection that they lose sight of what they started to do. This can happen in many areas of life, Virgo.

Step back and look over the situation again with a distanced view. Taking a break to have a fresh perspective can be just the thing you need.","interval":"20200229","reqDate":"20200229"}]}
