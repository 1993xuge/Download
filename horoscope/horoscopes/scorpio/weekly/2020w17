{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"A complicated financial situation could be on your mind as you begin this week, Scorpio. You may find yourself being quite confused not knowing how to best handle this situation. But if you take the time to talk to someone about this, you can clear the air and gain a much better understanding and a better grasp on the situation, which should ease your mind and help you find an optimal solution. You may be thinking about starting something new - something big. This may even be something you dreamt of as a child. But you may also be wondering if you have already passed the point of no return. But it is never too late to pursue a dream if you are driven to do so. Even if you have to put this on a back burner for a while and gather resources or ideas or do anything else that will better prepare you, you should not give up. Consider this seriously, because if you are still feeling the passion, then you owe it to yourself to see it through. A conversation you have this week - either one you are engaged in or one you overhear - could remind you of a connection you might like to reestablish. Even though you may not be able to reach out in person right now, you could start thinking through what you would like to say to rebuild that bridge and to make this connection strong again.","interval":"2020w17","reqDate":"2020w17"}]}
