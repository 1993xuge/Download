{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"The week may start out for you with a whirlwind of activity - some of it stressful enough to bring on some level of anxiety. But the pressure and the tension should quickly subside, allowing you to ease into a measured and rather serene routine. If you don't cave into those initial feelings of stress, Aries, this week can be phenomenally satisfying for you. There may be a chance to get back to a project that you have not had the chance to complete, which will be immensely fulfilling. You may also have a pleasant exchange with someone you would like to get to know better this week. This could be a chance to get closer to someone you have an interest in either professionally or personally, and this could be the start of a wonderful alliance. A revelation could come over you late in the week because of an intense conversation with someone you know well. This could hold the answer to a problematic matter you have been dealing with on your own. You should suddenly feel like you are not alone and that there is a solution, which should bring a big feeling of relief. This may have been a difficult point to reach, but it could turn things around for the better.","interval":"2019w47","reqDate":"2019w47"}]}
