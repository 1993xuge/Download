{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may have a vision for your future that others in your inner circle do not approve of or even understand. This month, you are challenged with finding a way to forge ahead anyway despite any negative commentary or criticism. Believing in yourself, in your intuition, and in what you want for your life will be key, and this month you should make great strides toward that goal. The further you go, the better you will feel about where you are going and how you plan to get there. Confident people like to say that failure is not an option. But actually, failure is sometimes a beneficial option because it teaches things you just can't learn in any other way. You may revisit a recent failure this month, but rather than being depressing or regretful, Aquarius, it could be validating and uplifting. And keep in mind that many huge successes began with a huge failure. Something good is waiting to enter your life. This may be a gift you have denied yourself because you did not feel worthy, so you accepted second-best - or even less - instead. But to accept this gift, you must first free yourself of whatever has been taking up space. You should feel especially capable of this in December. You may hit a detour or two this month, but don't allow that to discourage you from rising to the challenge and completing a mission. If you don't give up, you should find that help materializes when you need it most.","interval":"2019m12","reqDate":"2019m12"}]}
