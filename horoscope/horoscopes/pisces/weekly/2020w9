{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"A loving connection could be established or reestablished this week between you and someone you see as very special. If there is distance between you and someone you care for that occurred because of a conflict, the gap can be bridged by a mutual mission. If this is simply someone you wish to get to know, don't be shy about reaching out and sharing stories of your life, your hopes, and your dreams with that other person. This could be the beginning, or the continuation, of a beautiful connection. If you have become rather cynical about matters of the heart in recent months, Pisces, this week you may have the chance to believe in love again. It does not matter whether you are single or attached, a shared moment can put everything in your love life in a new and brighter perspective. There may be a strong focus now on your home life - not just how you operate your home but also on where you live. If you are not comfy and cozy in your home environment, it is time to make a change. People of your sign are at their happiest, their most productive, and most creative when their home space inspires them. Get motivated to make the changes you need to make now to bring your home to a place where it feels like your haven from the world. A nostalgic moment could transpire this week when you either catch up with or hear about someone from your past. But don't wish your life away wishing and thinking you could travel back in time. This is a great time to begin making new wonderful memories with family and friends.","interval":"2020w09","reqDate":"2020w09"}]}
