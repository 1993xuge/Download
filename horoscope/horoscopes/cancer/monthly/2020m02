{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You are a naturally kind individual, Moonchild. And that is because empathy is a big part of your nature, embedded in your soul. You can literally feel what other people are feeling, both good and bad, and you have seemingly endless compassion. This month, you may find that someone who has been observing the depth of your kindness and empathy has been observing you with great interest. And whether this is a romantic attraction, the beginning of a friendship, or someone who simply wants you on their team for some reason, this could be the start of something important in your life. And that's all because they have seen and admired your true nature. This month may also bring a wave of surprises from someone in your life that you have been close to for some time. There may be a revelation you were not expecting but had been hoping for. There may also be a secret that comes out in a most unusual way. This could be somewhat unsettling at first, but once it sinks in, it will explain a lot, which is a positive. If someone has owed you money, this is the month when you might finally get paid back. Although there may be some resentment over this, it is wise to just accept it and move on. Giving back may be emphasized this month with you finally being able to pay it forward to someone who helped you out. This is probably not a monetary situation; more likely, you will have the chance to help someone who once helped you, and the opportune moment will rise to do so.","interval":"2020m02","reqDate":"2020m02"}]}
