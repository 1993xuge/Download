You may not have your ducks in a row yet, Moonchild, but you may be very close. So, even if someone advises you to wait - but you are feeling the urge to move forward - then you should. There is nothing in this situation that doesn't spell out success for you. It will almost seem that you can do no wrong and that everything you touch is working out seamlessly. And guess what? You deserve it! A moment of perfect happiness could come through a family get-together this month, and it may be something that you initiate yourself. This could be related to a relationship that has gone sour or hasn't been as good as it once was, but it has been getting better. This move on your part could bring things back to the way they were, and that is really something to celebrate. Where love is concerned, you may have felt a bit dormant for the last few weeks or even much longer. But this month whatever was wrong will be fixed, and you will be transfixed seemingly by a magic spell that allows your love life to glitter. This will be a satisfying experience of great communion whether you are single or attached, so revel in it and recognize its importance in your life. This is truly a turning point for you, and the tough times you have experienced in the past are about to be forgotten as you usher into a new era of abundance, prosperity, and great joy.","interval":"2020m03","reqDate":"2020m03"}]}
