{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may be working on planning your rise to the top with a new adventure that has the potential to either make you money or achieve a goal you see as very important. This month, Leo, you will continue to create your plan, and you may be able to find assistance by searching through organizations that offer tutoring or guidance in your chosen pursuit. You may meet someone who understands your vision and can direct you along the proper path. When you want something, you are willing to work hard for it. But you do occasionally struggle with bouts of boredom that make it hard for you to concentrate, especially when you don't feel intellectually or artistically stimulated. This month, one such project may get a boost through inspiration that comes through some creative medium, such as a song or a book. Do as much as you can to get ahead with your goal because the weeks ahead may offer opportunities to jump on a train to success, and you will want to be prepared. A nervous or high-anxiety friend or loved one may get on your last nerve at some point this month, insisting that you get involved in something they need your help with. You may already have a full agenda and a schedule that stretches out for days or weeks, but this person may be persistent. If you can put it off, then do so. But if the pestering continues, you might want to at least create some kind of a plan so that you can move forward with your own tasks with a peace of mind.","interval":"2020m03","reqDate":"2020m03"}]}
