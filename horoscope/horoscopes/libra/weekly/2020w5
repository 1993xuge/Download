{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may find yourself questioning someone's motives this week as you team up in a joint effort. However, Libra, perhaps you should question your own motives instead. For example, are you getting into this because you feel it will be good for you and because it will make you happy? Or are you getting involved because you want to impress someone or because you feel obligated? Figuring out your own reasons will tell you what you need to do next. Someone could come to you this week inquiring about whether you would like to get involved in a project that is either community-based or related to business. Be careful about giving the wrong impression, or someone may proceed as though you are on board, even if you aren't yet fully sure. Just be as clear as possible about what you think and about your intentions. You may want to work through a project very quickly this week because you are super aware of a deadline. But if you rush through it, you may find that you could make mindless mistakes because you are hurrying, and you will have to do certain things over again. Take your time, and be patient with yourself for the best result. Late in the week, a difference of opinion does not have to escalate into an argument. Agreeing to disagree would be your best option.","interval":"2020w05","reqDate":"2020w05"}]}
