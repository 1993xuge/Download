If you are feeling sad, you might speak in a hopeful tone despite this. You are very likely to do this, Libra, because you don't like to make others feel bad just because you feel bad. But today, it is wise to allow someone special in your life to see and understand how you are feeling and why you are feeling that way. Not only can they help you feel better, but they can possibly help you make a breakthrough. Don't be reluctant to allow people deeper into your life today. You could use the help and encouragement.","interval":"20200421","reqDate":"20200421"}]}
