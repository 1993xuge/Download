{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"A real sense of belonging could sweep over you this month as you adjust to a new situation and new people in some area of your life - perhaps at work or in a new community. This may be something you have longed for but did not think you would have, Virgo, so the validation that is possible here should be very reassuring. But you should always assume you belong because as long as you are true to yourself, those who are good for you and deserve you will gravitate to you no matter what. You may find yourself feeling a lot more courageous in December and feeling ready to explore a new idea that seemed too out of reach in the past. Pour yourself into this and do so with confidence because new beginnings are possible now in this area of your life. A heartfelt conversation this month could free you of a limitation you have always put on yourself. You may have assumed that someone thought less of you or perceived you in a certain negative way, so you never reached for more in this relationship. But you should learn something this month that will alter that perception dramatically, freeing you to be yourself and give voice to what you really want. A hidden element of a legal or business matter may come to light in December, and it may be quite surprising. But once you adjust to this new information, you should be able to make a long-overdue decision. Late in the month, someone who has not shown their full appreciation for you may do so in a sweet and touching way.","interval":"2019m12","reqDate":"2019m12"}]}
