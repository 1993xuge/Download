This week, as you struggle with trying to get certain aspects of this back on track, you may come to see that this is what you should have been doing all along. The reception you receive from others who become privy to your efforts will be most rewarding and will propel you forward with great inspiration and motivation, Pisces. You have allowed other obligations to distract you and sidetrack you for too long. Now it is time to get down to business if you want to reap the rewards you know are coming to you. Get going! If you are single, you may be searching for the perfect partner and hoping to find them in some mystical, romantic way. Meanwhile, someone who has the best of intentions may express that you may not get everything you are looking for - but you deserve the perfect romance, and that is exactly what you should wait for. If you are attached, then this could be a blissful week for you ripe with opportunities for romantic moments if you make your relationship a priority, as it should be. You may have to face a painful truth this week about a friend or an associate. While this may not be an ideal way to end the week, it could actually be a blessing because you will finally understand something that transpired between you, and things will begin to make sense. This can end well, though, because when you experience a revelation, you will come to a new understanding that will help you move forward in the best way possible.","interval":"2020w12","reqDate":"2020w12"}]}
