{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may be considering a joint venture or even an investment with someone you believe would make a good partner. Because you get along quite famously with a certain individual, though, does not mean that you will make excellent partners where money or security are concerned. Before you commit to anything, Virgo, you need to flesh this out fully. Talk about how it will work, who will have what responsibilities and so on before you agree to anything. As long as you take the proper steps, this may work out successfully, especially if you share the same goals. You may have to shift gears this week with a project that has gone off the rails or at least experienced a bit of turbulence. You may feel like everything you have done so far has been for naught, but that really is not the case. You have been learning the whole time, and what you have learned should benefit you in the future, so don't lament what has occurred. Just do your best now, and you may even come up with a much better way of proceeding. You may be worried about disappointing someone with some presentation you are planning, but you should find the opposite to be true. You are at your best in this, therefore you are most impressive. Stop worrying and get into the spirit of it. Have fun with it, and others will too. You are at your very best when you allow yourself to enjoy an experience rather than fixate on the details.","interval":"2020w12","reqDate":"2020w12"}]}
