The air is filled with possibility around you, Moonchild, and you can probably even feel it sizzling. But once your desires are fulfilled, don't lose sight of how precious the gift is and start looking for the next big thing. Take some time to enjoy and appreciate what you have been blessed with.

You may find that those you have to deal with are more agreeable or resources that seemed to be missing will appear.
