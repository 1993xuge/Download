{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"A conversation you had a while back may have suddenly resurfaced in your thoughts. It may seem as if something just clicked, and you have to start thinking about it all over again from a new perspective. That would actually be a good idea because this month you may have a second chance at getting this conversation right and clearing up a misunderstanding. It may not be nearly as complicated as you thought it was, dear Leo, and once you start exploring other meanings and deeper sources for where those meanings came from, it will be so much clearer. This month could also be about transformation on another level. You may feel resentment over something you worked for that was handed off to someone else, but you can transform your thinking on this when you come to realize that you dodged a bullet - and by missing out on that opportunity, it put you in the path of something much better. A greater feeling of security may be possible for you in December as money flows in faster and more easily. But don't allow yourself to splurge too much if this happens because saving for a rainy day and for future ideas is a great idea this month. You may finally be able to close the door this month on an old chapter related to your love life. Although this may seem bittersweet in the moment, it will lift you up when you start to think about new possibilities. Once this realization sets in, you should feel that a weight has been lifted.","interval":"2019m12","reqDate":"2019m12"}]}
