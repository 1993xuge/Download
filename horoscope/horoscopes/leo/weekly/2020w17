You may be entering such a phase this week where you may start to think about what is the niche or direction where you can shine brightest. Whether you have aspired to something for a long time or not, you may be thinking a lot about what should be next for you. The universe is shedding light on a predicament you face where your destiny is concerned.

It is time to pay attention to what your life is pushing you towards, and start forging your own unique path, Leo. There could be a focus for you this week on presenting or publishing something you have been working on. You want to say something in just the right way, but if you speak from the heart, you will beautifully express what you feel - and that isn't something you need to rehearse.","interval":"2020w17","reqDate":"2020w17"}]}
