{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Someone in your life may not be giving you what you need emotionally, Leo. This person may seem to overlook your feelings or may not provide the kind of connection you hope for and deeply need. But could it be that they just don't know what you want or need? This week, it is wise to be more expressive of your wants and needs and to speak directly about that. Although you are a great communicator - and a dramatic communicator at that - not everyone is as richly blessed at communicating as you are. So, if you do reach out in this way, you may find it reciprocated. You could achieve a perfect vantage point this week to gain insight into something that is going on with a project you want to be involved with. Maybe this is connected to business or to something financial. You may feel like an outsider now, but if you pay attention carefully, you could learn things that will give you an inside track. A long-lost friend or loved one could pop up on social media or in a conversation with someone else. This may lead you to look into their whereabouts and to reconnect, which would be a great idea.","interval":"2020w14","reqDate":"2020w14"}]}
