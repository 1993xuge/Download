But if they don't appear grateful, Capricorn, it doesn't necessarily mean that they aren't. Sometimes when a person is in a desperate space, they don't freely express how they are feeling.

And most of all, trust in the belief that you have done a good thing.","interval":"20200106","reqDate":"20200106"}]}
