{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You are no April fool, Taurus, and that's a good thing. This month, you may find that an odd assortment of unusual opportunities will come to you. While this may sound like good news on the surface, some of these seeming opportunities may not be all that beneficial to you, and one or two may even be detrimental. Luckily, you are never someone who feels so desperate to succeed that you will just dive into anything that offers a promise of prosperity without looking before you leap. As long as you use good common sense this month, you will be nobody's fool. Also this month, April showers may bring showers of love, so to speak. Whether you are single or attached, you should experience some very delightful romantic moments to savor and cherish, and that will become the stuff of great memories in the future. Be open to adventures that involve a significant other or a potential new romantic partner, because you may be pleasantly surprised if you tread on unfamiliar territory. A family matter that seemed hopeless could be resolved quite happily this month, and while that may be surprising, it will also bring huge relief since you may have been at the center of it and felt obligated to get others on the same page. You should have a calming influence on others, as you so often do, and this will help them to come together in a unified and harmonious way. Never underestimate the power of bringing calm to a turbulent family issue.","interval":"2020m04","reqDate":"2020m04"}]}
