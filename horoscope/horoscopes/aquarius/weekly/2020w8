{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Be wary of someone's unusual generosity this week, Aquarius. If someone who is ordinarily stingy offers something that is quite generous, you shall find that there are ulterior motives. Although you are quite a smart person and will eventually figure this out, being more aware of it and identifying the issue earlier will stop you from extending your usual benefit of the doubt. Doubt is not always a bad thing, but probably not this time. Partnerships and joint ventures may be in focus this week for you. There may be an existing alliance that needs some work, and if you call a meeting to work out any differences you may have, it should work out well for all. Or if no partnership exists in your life yet, there may be one in the offing with someone you respect and possibly even admire. Someone's very direct approach this week might come off as callous and harsh, but it is probably just this person's style rather than a sign of deep dissatisfaction or anger towards you. Just take it at face value and be courteous in return. Setting a precedent of courtesy and compassion will make future engagements much better. The topic of a big life decision could come up this week such as making a move geographically, changing your job, or entering into a serious relationship. This is a great week to think about it deeply rather than to actually make a move. Just take your time and don't act until you are certain.","interval":"2020w08","reqDate":"2020w08"}]}
