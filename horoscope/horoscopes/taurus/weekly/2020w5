{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"The reputation of someone you respect and admire may have become a bit tarnished recently, Taurus, and you may learn about it this week. The worst part is that this person may have caused this to happen on their own, rather than this being the fallout of rumors. If this occurs, just remember that we are all only human, and we all make mistakes. Rather than judging or nurturing your own disappointment, be as supportive and encouraging as possible, and try to help your loved one find a way to make things right. That's probably what they would do for you if the situation were reversed. An accidental encounter or meeting could lead to a big development in your life related to money and success this week. Don't brush off someone who seems to cross your path in a serendipitous way, for there may be a purpose behind it. Take some time to talk, and you may find an almost surreal connection that should be explored. This could lead to something big. You may want to keep a disgruntled associate or neighbor at arm's length this week, for they may have the desire to drag you into the mud with them on a matter that is causing some upset among the people on your periphery. Even if you like this person, getting involved in this is not your responsibility, so choose to politely exit as soon as you can.","interval":"2020w05","reqDate":"2020w05"}]}
