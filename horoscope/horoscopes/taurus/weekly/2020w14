{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"If you are seeking a stronger spiritual connection with the universe and with the world around you, this week is a perfect time to begin reaching for that. You may be thinking about your purpose and also about your destiny and how to create the path you hope to travel. Reflection is important to you this week because you may feel a stronger pull in that direction, and there may be answers awaiting you if you do pursue this line of thinking. Developing a stronger spiritual link to the force of the universe will give you greater power to aim for and attract what you want. This week may also offer you a breakthrough in a difficult relationship. That does not mean that all of your conflicts and troubles with someone will magically disappear. But what it does mean, Taurus, is that you may find an easier way to approach this person this week, and if you are dedicated, you may discover that it is easier to get closer, albeit in a slow and measured way. End the week by reflecting on your blessings and by creating a plan for the weeks ahead that will make you constantly productive and in touch with what you want in life.","interval":"2020w14","reqDate":"2020w14"}]}
