If you are finding yourself keeping your distance from others this week or mulling over sad or upsetting thoughts too often, Moonchild, then a little bit of self-help will not only see you through, but could also lift your spirit significantly. Try writing down all the things you like about yourself and be thankful for them. Reach out to someone who admires you and always makes you smile. Start a deep conversation with someone who understands you. Try to find and read a good book that might offer answers to a dilemma you are facing. Or just find some other creative way to find a bright outlook - the sun is always shining somewhere. Throughout this week, you may have to deal with a lot of odds and ends that have been left undone for some time. Although this may seem like tedious work, there are ways to make your tasks fun. Put on some lively music, challenge yourself to perform tasks in a certain amount of time, or find some other way to put a spring in your step as you go about your efforts.","interval":"2020w14","reqDate":"2020w14"}]}
