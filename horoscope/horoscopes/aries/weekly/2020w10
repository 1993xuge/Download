{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"This week, Aries, your thoughts may be changing surrounding a long-held opinion - or perhaps not changing, but evolving would be a better word. Even though you have taken and will continue to take a broader view of a situation, you may be hesitant to share what you are thinking and feeling. There goes that fire sign stubbornness. You have a need to be right, and if you change your opinion, that makes you seem wishy-washy, right? Not necessarily. It makes you appear to be stronger than someone who sticks with an opinion just to prove something to someone else. Don't be afraid to share what you are working through. Sometimes having feedback from others helps you to arrive at the best place for yourself. You may be entering a time of study this week. This probably isn't something formal, but learning it fully and learning it well could be very important to your future success and financial security. Take it seriously, but not so seriously that you get stressed over the learning process. This is something you can excel at if you give yourself the chance. One area of your \"destiny\" may be revealing itself to you in a most interesting way this week. Although you can choose your destiny, there are certain possibilities that are put on your path, and it is up to you to pursue them or not. However, this is something that you have felt in your heart for a long time, so most likely you will feel intrigued by what is revealed to you throughout this week.","interval":"2020w10","reqDate":"2020w10"}]}
