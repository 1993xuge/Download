They give us greater confidence because we don't have to think about the things we do automatically and because we know what to expect, and we know that it has worked out before. But those habits we keep can also keep us back from trying something new. You have relied on a certain habit, which may have prevented you from reaching a certain goal. You could reach higher, Virgo, but you have not because knowing what to expect brings the security you crave. But you can have more if you take a small risk and get beyond the routine and the familiar.","interval":"20191201","reqDate":"20191201"}]}
