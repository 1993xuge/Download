{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may be hoping for a golden opportunity that will open a new world of interest to you, Capricorn. But you may have restricted the areas in which you are looking - either geographically or with other limitations. But if you expand your boundaries and look beyond the areas where you have limited yourself, you may find something so perfect for you that it will seem as if your name is written on it. Don't be afraid to reach for your dream. There is something you want very, very much now, and you may be planning to be fairly assertive in trying to get it. But if you use your intellect and your creativity rather than being pushy, you will not only get what you want, but you will shore up a strong foundation on which to build your goal. A cloudy mood might tempt you to indulge in some way to get over your melancholy. But if you find yourself wanting to open a giant bag of potato chips, go on a spending spree, or anything else that you might regret later, then you need to replace that desire with something that is more positive and more beneficial to you. An upcoming change may be on your mind this week, but your worries are misplaced. This is something to feel grateful for and look forward to because it can definitely change your life for the better.","interval":"2020w05","reqDate":"2020w05"}]}
