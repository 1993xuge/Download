{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"First of all, Sagittarius, do your best to stay calm and centered this week. You may have quite a lot to do, and it may already feel overwhelming to you. But remember that you are a hard-working, no-nonsense individual who is great at delegating and figuring out the fastest and most efficient way to get things done. If you don't lose sight of that and remain steady, you can achieve herculean feats this week. A last-minute invitation may come to you, but don't be standoffish about it. You may feel as though you were an afterthought to be included so late, but that's probably not the case at all. Instead, be grateful that someone thought of you and try to enjoy yourself. An aspiring dreamer may come to you for your expertise on something they want to do. Even if you see this person's plan as foolish, try to share your wisdom and insight anyway. Sometimes you never know - the most ridiculous ideas can become successful, and this may be one of those times. A friend or loved one might be a bit obsessed about talking you into something. Although it might have been amusing or entertaining at first, it is probably starting to get to you. This week, if it comes up again, be patient but firm. Draw a line and simply refuse to discuss the matter again. Eventually, they will get tired of the pursuit and leave you alone.","interval":"2020w11","reqDate":"2020w11"}]}
