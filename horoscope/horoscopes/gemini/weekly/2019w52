{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You could get caught up in a delightful conversation with a kindred spirit at the beginning of this week, Gemini, and that could set a wonderful tone for the rest of the week. This may be someone new or someone you only knew previously as a casual acquaintance. This could lead to a shared goal when you recognize an interest you both feel passionately about. What's more, this could become a long and enduring friendship or perhaps a romance. And someone you know quite well could show an entirely different facet of themselves this week to your delight. The best thing about evolving friendships is how we discover more that's beautiful about the people we care about the longer we know them. A shy person could cause your heart to overflow with emotion this week with a sincere expression of admiration. This person may tell you exactly what you need to hear at the moment, giving you incredible inspiration and a sense of gratitude that this message has reached you and motivated you to do something you have been thinking about. If someone approaches you this week with an offer that you find appealing - whether it is anything from a date to a job interview - don't play hard to get. Show your enthusiasm and how much it means to you, and this will validate what this person sees in you.","interval":"2019w52","reqDate":"2019w52"}]}
