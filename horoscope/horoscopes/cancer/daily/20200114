It is about being happy with who you are, where you are, and the people around you. If you are seeking harmony now, then constant striving to remove stress and strife from your life won't make a difference because those things will always come and go. Seek harmony by finding a peaceful way of dealing with absolutely anything you face. That is the power of true harmony.","interval":"20200114","reqDate":"20200114"}]}
