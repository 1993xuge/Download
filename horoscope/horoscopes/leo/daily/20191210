{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"A talented hypnotist cannot make his subject do anything that he does not want to do, as you might have seen on TV or even during a live performance. Hypnosis works by giving strong suggestions while someone is in a very receptive state of mind. You may want to get over a fear or a negative way of thinking about something you want to happen in your life. You need to know that you have the power within yourself to handle that. You can encourage yourself while in a tranquil place, just like during hypnosis, to be more open to your own power. And you don't need to rely on anyone else to reach that state of mind, Leo.","interval":"20191210","reqDate":"20191210"}]}
