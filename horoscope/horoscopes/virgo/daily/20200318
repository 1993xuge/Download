{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Standing up to a bully can seem like a frightening thing to do. When you don't know how someone will react or how far they will go to lash back at you for simply standing up for yourself, there is a scary level of uncertainty. But if someone is now trying to push you or provoke you into something, Virgo, try to reflect on what a bully really is.

Try being kind - but do stand up for yourself if needed.","interval":"20200318","reqDate":"20200318"}]}
