{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"At times, Aries, you are not tuned into the needs and emotions of the people who surround you. It is not because you are cold or because you are an unemphatic person. It is probably because you have a tough outer shell that is, at times, hard to penetrate. But tuning in to the emotions of those around you can be very powerful. Not only can you help others by picking up what they need, but you will also be more powerful because you will have a better understanding of what goes on with others around you. Try it out, even if it's just for a day today.","interval":"20191204","reqDate":"20191204"}]}
