{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"This week from the very beginning, you may find yourself feeling far more content and at peace than you have in some time. That may be counter to what is going on in the world around you or among the company you have been keeping, but that's because you have a strong mind, and you have probably worked at finding your center and finding good in the world. Keep this up, Capricorn, because you can be a voice of reason among those who are losing their way, and you will contribute significantly to your own good health and well-being. A lost item that is meaningful to you may turn up this week, or you may suddenly remember where you can find it. This item may have only sentimental value, but that is the best kind. A helpful friend or family member may offer you guidance on some matter that has been perplexing you. Even if you have not asked for help, take this person up on their offer. Although you are very independent, it can help to have someone lead you in the right direction in a team effort, and it can help you see a perspective that you would not ordinarily see.","interval":"2020w13","reqDate":"2020w13"}]}
