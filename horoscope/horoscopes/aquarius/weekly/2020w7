{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"This is a week to let go of doubt - doubts about choices you have made in your life, doubts about your talents, and doubts about what is possible for you in the future. You have spent a lot of time doubting recently, and while reflecting on your life can be good, too much harsh appraisal of your mistakes or wrong choices can only wear you down. Focus on your strongest traits and characteristics, your talents, your passions, and your vision for your life in the future. This is a great week for this kind of contemplation, and you may have the sense of an almost otherworldly spirit guide showing you what is possible. A mystery, possibly connected to your family, could begin to be uncovered this week. A random comment could lead to questions that will show you something you have always wondered about. This may help you understand someone in your life who was previously a bit of an enigma to you. This clarity could ultimately lead you to an improved, more open, and intimate relationship with this person. A responsibility you took on within an organization or at work could lead to a big break - one you have been hoping for. Don't get carried away too quickly, though, for there will be a lot to learn before you can rise as high as you hope to. A desire to free yourself of a long-held responsibility could come over you this week. But before you cut ties completely, you need to consider what other ways this might limit you. It might be wise to continue on with this for a little while longer.","interval":"2020w07","reqDate":"2020w07"}]}
