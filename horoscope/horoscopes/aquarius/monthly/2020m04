{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"April showers bring May flowers, as the old rhyme goes, but the showers can be hard to take when no rainbow is in sight. You might start out feeling that way this month, but rest assured, Aquarius, those flowers will be on their way eventually. There may be a down tone to the month at first, perhaps because of the mood of those around you or things that are going on along the periphery of your life. But keep in mind that even downtimes like that can be nurturing, encouraging, and a time to learn and grow. Just as rain nourishes the trees and the landscape, the sad or frightening moments in our lives can help build our strength and our confidence. Keep that in mind during trying times. Most likely, you won't have the chance to get too used to a difficult scenario because what starts out as dreary will soon give way to a bright ray of sunshine entering your life. This may come through an opportunity to improve your life in several ways, including ways that increase your financial security, and blessings in your personal life. Later in the month, someone you cultivated a relationship with may make you an offer that comes as a huge surprise. While it may seem unorthodox at first, it could become more and more appealing the more you think about it. Give it a chance.","interval":"2020m04","reqDate":"2020m04"}]}
