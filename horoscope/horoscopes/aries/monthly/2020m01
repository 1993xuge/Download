{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"There are some people who see January as the time when everything just slows down. There was a tremendous amount of activity, and then it just seems to stop. We may fall into a lull reflective of the season. The excitement of the holidays and the brand-new year has ended and we are looking ahead, but we don't really know what to expect. We may wonder if our plans will come to fruition and if our dreams for the new year will come true. But from the very beginning of the month, Aries, you need to develop a sense of hopeful anticipation. You need to see the year ahead as a beautiful blank canvas on which you can paint absolutely anything that you want. You have the power to do that. There is so much for you to look forward to, and a lot of it will begin this month. Some of the most important areas of your life that will be affected include your love life, which is likely to improve significantly whether you are single or attached. You should also find that your finances should get a boost - or at least the promise or proof of a boost - in January. You may also find that a long-simmering family feud will begin to settle down, with an irrational party becoming more realistic and letting go of certain unfair expectations. And that's just a start. Much more will begin falling into place this year, and it all starts with January.","interval":"2020m01","reqDate":"2020m01"}]}
