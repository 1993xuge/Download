This time of clarity and ease in expressing yourself makes this an excellent week for negotiating deals and aligning partners to help you manifest a big project. Allow the tranquil tone of the week to infect you with inner grace and peace, Scorpio, and everything you do will be blessed with laughter, joy, and some very bright hopes. You may feel especially inspired this week because you could receive messages inadvertently that encourage you to move forward with your dreams, messages that will help you believe your dreams are possible and are within reach. This is also a great week to spend some time indulging in your favorite hobbies. When you are feeling relaxed, the wisdom found in a good book or the creative expression you can get from enjoying artwork are magnified. Take some time to do whatever it is this week that appeals to you most, especially with creative self-expression.","interval":"2019w47","reqDate":"2019w47"}]}
