{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"The heart wants what the heart wants. That may well be your theme this week as you self-soothe to come down from the frantic energy of a challenging prior week. A bit of indulgence is fine, and it can even be good for you, Aries. The purchase of an expensive bauble you have had your eye on or a fine meal at a good restaurant can help you feel better because you are taking good care of yourself. But just be sure that you don't go overboard, or you could wind up with more stress or regret as you deal with overspending later on. A minor mistake with a financial matter could become obvious this week, but finding a mistake before it caused more damage is a good thing. An ordinary conversation this week could morph into a really deep exchange. Although this may come as a surprise, take advantage of the moment. Bring up a matter you have been hoping to discuss, and you can get to the bottom of an emotional issue. By the end of the week, a long-overdue culmination to a legal, contractual, or even a family matter may finally happen. This will also bring a big sigh of relief, for it may have seemed like an unending problem. Now you can move past this and on to better things.","interval":"2019w49","reqDate":"2019w49"}]}
