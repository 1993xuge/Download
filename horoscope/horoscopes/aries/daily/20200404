{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may think that if you admit that you don't know as much as someone thinks you know about something you are being trusted to do, that you will be perceived as less than capable. But actually, Aries, admitting you don't know everything is an unmistakable sign of confidence and strength. It shows that you are familiar with what you need, and you are willing to obtain it - be it knowledge or something else. It shows that you are honest. If you are having any thoughts about hiding something now, keep this in mind. If you are upfront and honest, you will be admired rather than criticized for it.","interval":"20200404","reqDate":"20200404"}]}
