But you may have sent a request out into the universe that was not answered, and you may wonder if you are seen as worthy or valuable. The answer is unequivocal - yes you are. Take a few moments today to look out the window and see the blessings that surround you. There are people who care about you whether you recognize it or not. There is a world of opportunity out there accessible with some effort. You were born with special talents. You have a lot going for you. Be grateful for that and more.","interval":"20200413","reqDate":"20200413"}]}
