They all just assumed that you would drop whatever you were doing and take care of business. You probably kept reinforcing that belief because you are always so reliable and are there for those you love. It can be exhausting. But recent demands on your own time may have forced you to cut back a bit on this. That's a good thing. Although it may not be intentional, you are adjusting expectations, which means there will be fewer demands on your time. Keep it that way - even when things ease up for you.","interval":"20191201","reqDate":"20191201"}]}
