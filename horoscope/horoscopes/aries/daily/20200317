{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You are a very reasonable person, Aries. You don't usually allow yourself to get caught up in conspiracy theories or irrational fears. Your logic is grounded. You tend to believe in the common sense above all. But when there is something you want passionately, you do occasionally allow your imagination to run away with you; then once that happens, worst-case scenarios may come to mind, and you may become caught up in a fearful idea. If you feel yourself going there today as you work at getting something you want, just stop yourself and get your mind back on the right track.","interval":"20200317","reqDate":"20200317"}]}
