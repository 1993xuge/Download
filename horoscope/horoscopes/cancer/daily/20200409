{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"As a Moonchild, you are a deep well of love and emotion. You love tradition, and you love family. Because you tend to be so emotionally available, you are often the one that others come to in times of need or when they need guidance because you exude a maternal\/paternal feeling. These are traits of your sign. Other signs have different strengths and weaknesses, some of which balance yours out beautifully. You may meet someone today or very soon who is very different from you, but that does not mean you can't complement each other in some way. Be open to that now.","interval":"20200409","reqDate":"20200409"}]}
