Where we would ordinarily be very discriminating in what we dispose of, we get so sick of all the stuff that we might throw out something that is useful in a bout of decluttering. If you are in that mood now - with actual clutter or with something even bigger in your life, dear Moonchild - then consider not throwing anything away without thinking about it for a day or two. This will prevent you from doing something right now and delay things but are likely to be grateful that you did later on.","interval":"20191221","reqDate":"20191221"}]}
