{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Despite your sometimes gruff and aggressive exterior, Leo, you are a kind-hearted kitten. You would go to any length to help someone out that you care about. But sometimes your kindness gets you into trouble when you overextend yourself or you go too far or help someone too often. There are people who may come to rely on your kindness and even take it for granted or take advantage of it. This week be aware of someone who has asked you for help once too often. Do not let this become a pattern. You may have to make a tough choice this week. You may not be concerned because the outcome will be negative but because you want things to turn out in the absolute best way possible. Because this is a tough decision, you may consult with someone else after becoming frustrated. But be sure that whatever you do, it is what feels right and best for you - not for someone else. You will reap the rewards of the best choice, so live with it for a while before you decide.","interval":"2020w13","reqDate":"2020w13"}]}
