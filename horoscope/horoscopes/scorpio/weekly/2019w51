{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"This week is a time to be a realist about your dreams, of which you probably have many. You are indeed a dreamer, Scorpio, and you sometimes get so lost in all of the possibilities that you don't focus on just one. Start by concentrating on the one that is the most important to you, but also the most viable at this time. That does not mean that everything you want is not possible - it just makes it easier to dwell on what is more readily attainable. The achievement of one's dream can lead to greater confidence in achieving the rest. So, make a point of this throughout the week. A playful energy is settling into your space this week, and you may have the urge to go out and do something fun and unusual. Bring along a friend who knows how to have fun, which will lift your spirits. Patience will be very important to you this week as you deal with a friend or neighbor who wants things their way even though it won't work out so well for you. This \"my way or the highway\" attitude could shift if you respond with thoughtfulness and empathy toward this person even if it does not seem to be deserved. A last-minute invitation could offer a fun time late in the week with the chance to meet some very interesting people. Even though you may have a heavy workload, a break from all of that would be good for you and will invigorate your energy.","interval":"2019w51","reqDate":"2019w51"}]}
