You may have recently experienced a few trials with someone who seems to be followed by trouble. Perhaps this person turns to you only when things are going wrong, and you've had enough. But it may be that you are thought of as so wise and so intelligent that you are sought out whenever things seem impossible, and in a way that's a compliment. Before you give up on a friendship, Aquarius, express how you feel. Let it be known that more positive exchanges would be valued, and you may see things turn around.","interval":"20200131","reqDate":"20200131"}]}
