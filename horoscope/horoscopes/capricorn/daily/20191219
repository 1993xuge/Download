{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Sadness happens when we are disappointed, when our feelings are hurt, or when we lose something we treasure. And when we focus on these sad things, it can take over our mood and our entire day. Although we all experience unhappiness in our lives, we also have the capacity to experience a lot of joy. Sometimes the antidote for unhappiness is to turn our attention to the beauty around us and focus on the good in our lives. You have plenty of that, Capricorn, even if you don't notice it on a routine basis. Start doing more of that, and you will invite in a wave of happiness.","interval":"20191219","reqDate":"20191219"}]}
