{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"If someone approaches you this week with an offer to become involved in a big project, don't be quick to decline. You often underestimate your abilities, especially where business or concrete frameworks are involved. Most Pisces see themselves as fluid and free-flowing, not liking to be tied down to rules or organized ventures. You want to be able to go with the flow and to follow your creativity, but it could be a great challenge to take this on and to show yourself how much you are capable of. You are someone who has an odd and eclectic collection of friends and associates. Because there are so many facets to your personality, you attract a wide range of individuals. Your charm and open mind draw in people who might not ordinarily meet each other through any other avenue. But this week, be very careful about bringing certain of these people together. Remember that fire and water don't always mix well, and sometimes, if left unattended it leads to disaster. Beware of someone who is overly flattering this week. It isn't that what they say about you isn't true. Yes, of course, there are so many wonderful things to admire about you. But there are people out there who will use insincerity to draw someone in, and because you are so kind and open, you want to give everyone a chance to speak their mind. But if you remain alert to someone who may try to take advantage of you, you will be perfectly fine. A meet and greet at a community event or an event at a friend's house could introduce you to someone who could play a pivotal role in your future this week.","interval":"2020w11","reqDate":"2020w11"}]}
