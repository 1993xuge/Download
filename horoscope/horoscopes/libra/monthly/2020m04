{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"When things go wrong and people happen to be on very different sides of a dramatic happening, there is always a lot of blame to go around. But what good can come from blaming others, especially when there are far more positive things that could be done. Rather than getting caught up this month in feeling bitter or resentful over a situation you may find yourself in, try to find something uplifting and positive about a predicament. There is always something hopeful in even the most trying circumstance. You may never find a truth you have been seeking about someone you care about, Libra. Perhaps figuring someone out has become something of an obsession for you, but it may be just a waste of time. What you discover may not matter all that much, especially when you could benefit more from finding common ground, building trust, and generally improving a relationship. If you are meant to have the knowledge you have been seeking, let it go, and it will come to you eventually. Something unfair that happened to you in the last several months left you feeling somewhat disappointed or disillusioned. But this month, things may turn around, and what was wrong could be made right. While this may be very satisfying, you must always learn a lesson from this experience. Sometimes the most disappointing moments have a happy ending.","interval":"2020m04","reqDate":"2020m04"}]}
