{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may believe that someone or something in your life is sabotaging your potential or making your life unpleasant in some other manner. But nothing and no one can do that without your permission. A relationship can bring emotional upheaval, but it can only continue to do that if you maintain the relationship as it is. You can be unhappy in a job, but if you don't like your job, you can seek out other opportunities. Don't make excuses for some aspect of your life that you see as undesirable. Do something about it, Pisces!","interval":"20191205","reqDate":"20191205"}]}
