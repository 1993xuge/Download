Although we may like the phrase \"birds of a feather flock together,\" it doesn't necessarily mean that different people cannot be close. Sometimes someone who is very different from you can balance you out. Their strengths can complement your strengths and so on. But we don't always take the time to truly get to know someone who is very different from us. Today, Pisces, take a chance on that. If you meet someone intriguing, but you think you might not fit in with that person, be friendly anyway and get to know them if you can. You may find a great friend!","interval":"20200322","reqDate":"20200322"}]}
