{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Someone you may meet this week through someone else that you know casually - such as a neighbor, a coworker, a clerk in an office, etc. - could be quite compelling and interesting to you, Gemini. This could be the beginning of a new relationship - a friendship, or even something more serious related to romance if you happen to be single. But take this new relationship slowly, for there is much to know, and it could progress quickly given the intensity of the attraction. A minor repair to a car or around the house could cause you to dig into your pockets, but if you look around, there may be a friend or relative who would be willing to help you out. You might even find a way to do this yourself if you can find proper help in the form of a tutorial, or guidance from someone who has done it or has some knowledge of the matter at hand. You may be thinking about making a sizable purchase of something related to technology. Although this may not be the best week to make such a purchase, you should start investigating what it is that you want and need. Doing this the smart way with thorough research prior will ensure that you purchase something that is ideal for your needs and fits your budget as well as being future proof. Friends and family members might roll their eyes if you present an idea you have been thinking about this week, but don't let that dissuade you from giving it a try anyway. This may lead to another idea, which could actually be quite good and more grounded. That's how great ideas form sometimes.","interval":"2020w07","reqDate":"2020w07"}]}
