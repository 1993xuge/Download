{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"If you wanted to make a big purchase - say a new car, for example - you are sure to do some research and shop around both online and offline. The experience would be very well thought out so that when you make a purchase you have the ability to negotiate with some level of knowledge and confidence. But if you were to purchase a car at an auto auction, it might be a different story. The pace is quicker, and there is someone competing against you. You may buy something unwise on impulse, and you may pay more than you should. This month, Gemini, be wary of situations where you are under pressure or in an agitated emotional state if you need to acquire something important or costly. Don't let the \"auction\" mentality cause you to do something you might later regret. If you begin this month in an agitated state of mind - perhaps because of what is going on in the world around you - you have two options. You can give into and feed that sense of agitation by dwelling on unpleasant thoughts, which will only leave you miserable. Or you could choose to transform your thinking into thoughts of positive outcomes and happy times ahead. Although we can't control what goes on in the world, we can take care of ourselves and enjoy the world around us rather than fearing it. You can deprive yourself of happiness and a sense of security - or you can draw in a feeling of happiness and security. The choice is yours.","interval":"2020m04","reqDate":"2020m04"}]}
