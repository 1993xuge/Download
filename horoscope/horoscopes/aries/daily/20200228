{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"A dream that you have worked for and fought for is coming very close. You probably have not shared this dream with many others for fear of failing or being vulnerable. Therefore, Aries, you may be inclined to put it off again in order to accomplish tasks that others ask of you. But you owe it to yourself to accept any opportunity you receive to make this happen - even if you have to risk feeling vulnerable. You can only be in one place at a time, and accepting the chance to bring a dream to fruition is what's most important now. Don't put it off.","interval":"20200228","reqDate":"20200228"}]}
