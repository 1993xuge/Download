{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"As March begins, Capricorn, you may be more entranced with love and romance than you usually are. This may just be the mood you are in because of warm and loving vibrations that surround you, but it may also be because you are reaching a new level of commitment with someone special. Or, if you are single, you may have a stronger desire to get out and find someone who can become very special to you. Is that possible this month? Indeed, it is! But being open to meeting people who might ordinarily exist outside of your normal social circle could be important to finding that someone special you are hoping for. Fear of the unknown or of failing could cause you to turn down a big opportunity that could come your way this month. But that could be a very big mistake. Don't allow a lack of self-confidence to destroy a chance that might not come again anytime soon, if ever. Even if you are feeling timid or apprehensive about trying, you need to try anyway. Spend some time thinking about the many wonderful qualities you possess that make you a great fit for this chance. You can also repeat positive affirmations to build up your enthusiasm. Anyone can fail, but someone who does not try is sure to fail. On another goal that you were once very enthusiastic about, you may be developing a case of cold feet. This probably isn't because of a lack of confidence, but because you aren't sure it will be worth your while. Give yourself some time to think about it, and weigh your options and the pros and cons before you make any decisions.","interval":"2020m03","reqDate":"2020m03"}]}
