{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"It is easy enough to say that positive thinking brings good things into your life. And although positive statements like that one are a good start, Aries, they are not enough. Sometimes you have to work at believing what you say because no matter how many times you say something hopeful, it won't work if you don't feel it in your heart. Something you want very much is attainable. Try to take several moments throughout the day to think about it as a reality, rather than just a dream. The more you do, the more you will believe it is possible and the closer you will be to manifesting that dream in your life.","interval":"20200211","reqDate":"20200211"}]}
