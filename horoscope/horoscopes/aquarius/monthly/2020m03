{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"This month, Aquarius, you may find yourself considering a big change in some area of your life that consumes a lot of your time and attention. This could be anything from your career to an important relationship. While this is not necessarily due to any terrible experiences connected to this part of your life, it may be a longing that you feel you need to satisfy. You may have discovered a lack of fulfillment, and you may be on a quest to find more to fulfill your purpose. Although it is always a good idea to spend some time exploring this kind of feeling, making a drastic move right now is not advised. This may be a feeling that will dissipate in time, or you may need more of a chance to hone in on exactly what it is that you are looking for. Don't be hasty in making a big change. If you find yourself feeling extra stressed or out of sorts this month, then surround yourself with familiar things that bring you comfort. You may want to visit your favorite coffee shop and just relax with the paper, take a walk in an area that brings you a feeling of peace, talk to an old friend who gets you better than anyone else does, and so on. In other words, pamper and nurture yourself to bring back your sense of well-being. A matter connected to your security, financial or otherwise, could come up later in the month. It might be best to seek out expert advice for this, even if you would prefer to keep this to yourself. If you can't figure out how to resolve this quickly, nip it in the bud by finding guidance so that you can restore your confidence and ease your mind.","interval":"2020m03","reqDate":"2020m03"}]}
