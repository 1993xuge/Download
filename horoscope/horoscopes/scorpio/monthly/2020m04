{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"A problem that you keep pushing to the back of your mind may recur in full force this month. At that point, Scorpio, you may no longer be able to avoid thinking about it or doing something about it. While you are perfectly capable of handling this, there may be some awkward aspect to this that you would not want to deal with, especially if it involves sharing something personal about yourself. But if you bring this out into the light of day, you should find that it feels refreshing and right, and it will seem as though several pounds have fallen off your shoulders. This is a great month for networking, especially if there is a project you are hoping to get off the ground soon. You may be able to connect with others who can offer you guidance and feedback, and maybe even open up a few doors for you. You could meet someone who could partner with you, or at least develop a lucrative arrangement for launching some of your ideas. Paperwork that you have been putting off may finally have to be dealt with in April. Although this may be tiresome and dull, getting it over with must be one of your big priorities. If you procrastinate any longer, you may create some unnecessary problems, and those will be far worse than actually dealing with that paperwork! There may be someone in your life with whom communication has been strained. But somehow the fog will lift in the weeks ahead, and you may find it far easier to communicate. Take advantage of this so you can strengthen your bond.","interval":"2020m04","reqDate":"2020m04"}]}
