{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Your step may be happier and your vibration may be lighter and more carefree this week. This should allow you to finally breathe a long overdue sigh of relief. You are feeling more optimistic about your prospects for the future, perhaps because 2019 has ended and a new year with bright new possibilities has arrived. This year does hold good fortune for you, Capricorn, but don't forget about living in the moment, for the here and now is truly where you live. This is a great week to show off your greatest talents, for there could be opportunities around that will suit you perfectly, and displaying your natural gifts will give others a chance to see all that you offer, which could lead to some big opportunities. This could also be a week when some interesting people will pop up in some of the most mundane places. Don't be shy about striking up a conversation with someone new that you find intriguing. There could be someone hovering around who will really feel like a kindred spirit, and this would be a good person to get to know better. You may clash with someone this week who seems very different from you - but if you are open to a candid conversation, you may discover that you have far more in common than you would have thought, making this a potential friend and ally.","interval":"2020w02","reqDate":"2020w02"}]}
