{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Good writing has a unique rhythm to it. A great book will draw you in because the words bring you a rise and fall of emotion and dramatic inflections. Keep this in mind if you are about to engage in an important conversation. Though it is not the same as writing or reading a book, dear Libra, the words you say and how you say them can have a profound influence on the outcome of any conversation. Don't be afraid to add a bit of creative expression and drama to an upcoming conversation.","interval":"20200321","reqDate":"20200321"}]}
