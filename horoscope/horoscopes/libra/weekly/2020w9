{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"An obstacle that comes out of the blue this week may seem to impede your progress on a major goal, Libra. However, it will be all in how you look at your situation that will make the big difference. While this may seem to stop you in your tracks, dear Libra, if you can look at this in a more holistic way, you can see that there are advantages to this apparent disappointment. Be as creative as you can be in your appraisal, and you will learn something very valuable, and you may even get further ahead more quickly because of it. A certain person in your life has been keeping you on your toes with one of your missions because they expect so much of you. Although this may be irritating at times, dear Libra, it is also a positive thing for you because you are performing at a high level and accomplishing even more than usual. This is helping you to build confidence in an area of your life where you may not always feel all that competent. Let this validate that you are. You may encounter someone this week who doesn't seem to like you very much. This person's churlish behavior might give you the feeling that you are disliked for some reason you can't figure out, but you may find that with kindness and understanding you will feel that this is just a defense mechanism and nothing personal. Be open to a friendship with this individual. A chance to get involved with a new group of people via a club or organization could come to your attention this week. Explore it because it could have much to offer you.","interval":"2020w09","reqDate":"2020w09"}]}
