{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Friendships - especially one friendship that has been in the background of your life - may come more prominently to the forefront this week. You certainly treasure your friends, Pisces, but perhaps you haven't devoted as much time to them recently as you would have liked. Events that will happen this week could push you toward connecting with someone, and it will be a joyous reunion, even if it hasn't been all that long since you got together. Someone special might have something significant to share, which will brighten your life in some way. You should find yourself set free from an obligation or an unfortunate situation this week. Even though getting to that point might be awkward and upsetting, once it happens you will have a brand new beginning that will become more and more beneficial to you, so hold your head high throughout this experience, for there is also a lot to learn here. If you have been wondering a lot about how you can be a force of change in the world, the answer for you will be through your creativity and your sensitivity. Your empathy should come into play this week in a way that will enlighten and inform you on your next steps toward your future.","interval":"2020w15","reqDate":"2020w15"}]}
