{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"When people are in the midst of a stressful situation, they may find various ways of dealing with it. Some people may get further involved in work and other projects in an effort to keep their mind off whatever is troubling them. Other people will find more intense ways to relax such as taking on a daily routine that incorporates some type of soothing activity like meditation. This week, Aries, if you are feeling stressed, find what can work for you to take your mind off any troubles and uplift your spirit. This is important to your well-being. If you have been pushing for an answer from someone in recent weeks and not getting that answer, then this is probably the time to lay off for the duration and be more patient. Sometimes putting pressure on someone will only drive them inward. But if you offer a break from asking the same question over and over, the answer may come more easily to you. At the end of the week, no matter what worries you may be facing, take some time to look around and appreciate the good things in your life.","interval":"2020w13","reqDate":"2020w13"}]}
