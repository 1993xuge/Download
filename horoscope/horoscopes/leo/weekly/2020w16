{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"When something feels right, it is right. Right, Leo? Well, not necessarily. Although pretty much anyone can be intuitive and have feelings about how something will go, there are other factors that can influence what we feel. You have a tendency, dear Leo, to become very passionate about projects you have your eye on, and sometimes you are blind to the related developments because you become so emerged and enthused. This week there is a possibility for an impressive possibility to emerge - but at this stage, it may not go beyond that. Live with this for a while and allow yourself to see it realistically. It may hold great potential, but you need to be logical in how you approach it so that you can see the possible downfalls - not just the perks. There may be a focus on learning and study this week. This may be connected to a calling of yours - something that has been a hobby, but something you would love to turn into a lucrative outlet. This does hold promise, but it will take some study to get up to speed. Keep at it, and you may reap big rewards later on.","interval":"2020w16","reqDate":"2020w16"}]}
