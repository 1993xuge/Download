{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Positive feedback over a job that was well done from someone you look up to could feed your confidence and leave you feeling very good about yourself and your potential this week. You may even decide to take on a challenge you might have shied away from at some other time, Pisces, and that would be a great idea. Don't hesitate to indulge and enjoy this new sense of personal pride and inspiration, for this can be a week with many small successes that will lead to something even bigger and more rewarding. Your money picture is looking brighter this week, and although you may not exactly win the lottery, you should be able to make some amazing connections that could lead to increased income or even a windfall of some sort. If you have a regret you have had a hard time letting go of, this is a good week to cast it securely into the past and don't dare look back over your shoulder. Events of this week could help you make up for that regret and set you off on a new and more fruitful path. Listen carefully if someone approaches you for a personal conversation this week. There may be an important message you will need to receive with grace and understanding. Doing so could get an important relationship back on track successfully. Cap off your week with a visit to an art gallery or a museum. Your mind may be longing for a richer intellectual experience right now.","interval":"2019w49","reqDate":"2019w49"}]}
