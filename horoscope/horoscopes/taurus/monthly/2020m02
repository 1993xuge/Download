{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"New doors are opening for you this month, Taurus, with possibilities in some very important areas of your life. Money is one concern that may have been on your mind recently, and while you may not suddenly become rich this month, you may find that several opportunities will pop up that could lead you down the path to a stronger financial situation. Hard work, of course, will be required, but with your strong work ethic, you are certainly qualified. Your career could pick up with expansion in a key area of interest, or there could be some opportunity to get involved in a venture that stands to be quite lucrative. An unfinished conversation with a person close to you may open up again this month, and you may still have the desire to change the subject. But if you do, you will only be putting off the inevitable. If you have some urge to avoid this that you can't figure out, you need to take some time this month to analyze why you feel this way. Once you understand whatever is holding you back, it should become easy to engage. Someone has been working behind the scenes to help you with a certain issue. Although you have seen the results of this assistance, you may not have realized who was helping - or that it was intentional. But if this is a profoundly big lift up, you need to express how important it is to you and show your gratitude.","interval":"2020m02","reqDate":"2020m02"}]}
