{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"If you start every single day this week with positive affirmations about what you want from your day, your week, and the year, you will set out on a positive path to accomplishing so many of your goals. If this becomes a pattern for you, it will help you to build confidence and to maintain a strong sense of purpose, dear Pisces - so be disciplined about it. A sense of direction may be the only thing you are lacking right now, and once you get on track with that, this can be an amazing year. This week offers so much in the way of building a foundation for making your dreams come true, so be alert and aware of any opportunities that come your way, no matter how seemingly small. This is a great week to start figuring out how you can work harder rather than smarter to make the most of a project that is dear to your heart. You may fear that there is just too much to do for this, and you may not have the help you need to get it all done in a timely fashion. But if you can create a strong plan, you can streamline your work and get more out of it with less time and energy. You may be considering an investment now, either of time or money. But being fully aware before you go all in is essential because there may be a bit of information missing from what you know so far. Take some time to explore this fully before making any commitments.","interval":"2020w03","reqDate":"2020w03"}]}
