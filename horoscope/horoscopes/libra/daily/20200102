But you have exactly the same capacity to enjoy a richer, easier, fun-filled life as this person or anybody else. The way to achieve that, though, is not through envying someone else's life, Libra. Admiring what someone else has and being happy for them is never wrong. But envy or longing to live another person's dream is pointless. If something is missing, go get it. You have the ability to create your own perfect life.","interval":"20200102","reqDate":"20200102"}]}
