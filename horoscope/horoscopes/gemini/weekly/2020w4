{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"This week it may be all about letting go of the old to welcome in the new. That may be hard for you, Gemini, even though you are someone who adapts rather easily to change. But this may be a change of something that has been with you for a long time, so it may be more difficult than usual. But once you do let go, you should feel a rush of good fortune gracing you and changing any negatives to positives. This may be partly about moving outside of your comfort zone, but you will adapt quickly once you step over that line. You may have the desire to seek out a mentor this week as you strive to learn something new that will either benefit your career or will allow you to expand on a hobby that you would like to take more seriously. Just such a person may appear as you begin to look. If there is a money issue you are worried about, this is a great week to do something about it. You may not be able to resolve it fully right now, but you can take steps to improve things if you can create a viable plan with steps that can take you logically to where you want to be. You may also want to pare down your budget, stripping away unnecessary expenses and cutting back on things that you don't necessarily need. Doing so will free you to see what is most important to you as you start building your finances up.","interval":"2020w04","reqDate":"2020w04"}]}
