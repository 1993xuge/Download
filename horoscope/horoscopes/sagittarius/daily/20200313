You see no advantage to being loquacious and going on and on in an effort to convince someone of your opinion or your direction. But sometimes a bit of coaxing is important. Even in situations where you have the final say, it is good to help others understand how you arrived at a certain conclusion, or why your position is a good one. Not only will it build a better rapport with others, but it will also give them greater confidence in you.","interval":"20200313","reqDate":"20200313"}]}
