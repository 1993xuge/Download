{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You are someone who feels things very deeply, Scorpio, although it doesn't always appear that way on the outside. Sometimes you don't even admit how you feel to yourself. You keep your deepest emotions hidden for fear of becoming vulnerable or emotionally overwhelmed. But there is no shame in showing what you feel or in being vulnerable. In fact, it can be quite nice when others share those feelings with you. There may be a good reason to share something you are feeling now with someone special. Go ahead, take the plunge. You are most likely not going to regret it.","interval":"20200418","reqDate":"20200418"}]}
