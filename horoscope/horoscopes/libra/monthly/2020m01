{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Every mistake or bad choice in life is like a brick you can use to build a better future for yourself. If you choose to see it that way, Libra, you will count a recent mistake among your blessings. This month is the time to look for the purpose behind situations like that mistake and find the benefit of what happened. Punishing yourself is simply pointless. If you build a future on a foundation made partly of mistakes, it will be incredibly strong. Consider that now. An investment opportunity may come to you this month, but it may seem more like an investment of faith in someone you care about. If you believe in this person's dreams, you will stand by that person as they rise above a current challenge. Investing your faith and belief in this individual will reap dividends for you later on because of the connections you make through that person. If you were to plant a fruit tree, it would be a few years before the fruits of your labor would appear. During those years while waiting, you would resign yourself to that tree remaining bare for a while, and so when the fruit appears, it would be a joyful experience. You may have a similar experience soon when an effort you started long ago finally bears fruit toward the end of this month. You might even forget where it came from, but you need to remind yourself, because you deserve to recognize that you are reaping the rewards you worked for. You may discover this month that a friend's unusual behavior is based in part on a personal metamorphosis, and that understanding will help you to be a great source of support.","interval":"2020m01","reqDate":"2020m01"}]}
