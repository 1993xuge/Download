{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may receive an invitation or the chance to become involved in a group or organization that you have always wondered about early in the month, Virgo. However, you may be afraid that you won't fit in, and this could affect your decisions negatively. But you should not worry about fitting in because you are such a genteel and likable person that even if you have little in common with others who are involved, you will be admired and welcomed warmly. You have been looking for a purpose in some area of your life - perhaps with the desire to explore a career or a dream that you have flirted with for a long time, but maybe one you have been too afraid to try. This is a great month to really dig in and discover what your purpose is related to this. If you do, you may find that things will fall into place quite easily, and someone who could guide you could appear to help you in learning what you need to know. A mistake you made in the long-ago past may have had some long-lasting ramifications. In fact, you may still be dealing with some problems associated with that mistake. But this month, the chance to undo some aspect of this that has caused it to be so difficult may come to you, which can change everything. A transition in the way you see someone in your life may occur this month as well. Someone you had trouble understanding but loved anyway may reveal some deeper aspect of themselves that will help you grow closer and have a greater appreciation for this person's challenges.","interval":"2019m11","reqDate":"2019m11"}]}
