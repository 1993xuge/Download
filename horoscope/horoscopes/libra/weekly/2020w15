{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may have a strong desire this week to begin pursuing one of your dreams, but are you fully prepared, Libra? Usually, you are someone who likes to go into something new with a strong foundation that is carefully built, but right now you may be a bit more impulsive. Stay grounded, plan carefully, and resist the urge to start anything prematurely. The longer you work at this, the more confidence you will have and the more impressive you will be to handle the needed tasks - or to anyone whose assistance you may require. This also goes for an opportunity that may come to you this week. You may be feeling especially ambitious, and you will want to seize this chance and rush forward with it right away. But again, it is wise to wait patiently, gather information and resources, and look for the right moment to begin, which may be a few weeks into the future. In the meantime, get prepared. If you have to deal with a pushy person this week on some essential matter, just take a deep breath and draw a line. You may want to give in just to keep from being annoyed, but it would be best to resist any brash behavior so that you can set a precedent.","interval":"2020w15","reqDate":"2020w15"}]}
