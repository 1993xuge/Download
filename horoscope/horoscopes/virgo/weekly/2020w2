{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"The weight of the world may seem to ride on your shoulders as this week begins, Virgo, but don't worry about it because before long, the feeling of heaviness will fade away. You may be taking on a role that is filling you with worry, and you take the responsibility of it very seriously. You may think that it is more than you can handle, but it would not have fallen on you if that was the case. Once you begin working on this project, you will see that you are perfectly cut out for it, and you should come to actually enjoy it. By the time it is over, you will wish there was even more to do. An impending deadline on a work, school or a home-related project could be pushed back much to your relief. This may be sidelined for quite a while, so in the meantime, try to do as much as you can to make it easier when it resumes. Someone's shady behavior may cause you to fear trusting them with a confidential matter. Your instincts are right on this, and you need to heed what you are feeling. If you hold back, you will find someone else who is far more qualified and worthy of your trust. There could be a big gain with an endeavor you have put a lot into this week. This effort may begin to pick up steam rapidly, and you can move forward with it very quickly. A lot of the action that can propel this forward may take place this week.","interval":"2020w02","reqDate":"2020w02"}]}
