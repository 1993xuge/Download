{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may be feeling very generous toward someone this week, and because of this, you may cut short some of your many options for a new opportunity. But this is the time to put yourself first, Scorpio, and to do what is best for you first rather than for someone else. While being selfless at times is a wonderful virtue, you are at a pivotal point now where putting someone else before yourself could set you back in your career or with an important personal project. Make the choice that works best for you. An investment you may now be exploring or will explore very soon could pay off with enhanced abundance and prosperity. But don't expect this to be a get-rich-quick scheme, or you may be disappointed. This is something that can steadily grow and become fairly big, but it will require time and effort. Someone may challenge you to aim for a big goal this week. Take that challenge and urge yourself on. Use your competitive spirit to inspire you and to propel you forward. Winning this challenge could be very fulfilling to you spiritually and in terms of your own confidence. A roadblock with a current endeavor has been very frustrating. Perhaps you have tried many things to work your way around it. But this week, it could suddenly just fall away and allow you to move ahead quickly with a plan.","interval":"2020w05","reqDate":"2020w05"}]}
