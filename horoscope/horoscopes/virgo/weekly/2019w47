{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"This could be a week of misunderstandings, Virgo, but don't let that bother you, even if it sounds alarming. That's because misunderstandings can eventually lead to a clearer understanding and better communication if you address whatever is wrong. If you do try to clarify a complex situation this week, you will be met with all the help you need. For fear of getting too deeply involved in a friend's or a family member's drama this week, you may choose to hide in the shadows rather than speak your mind. But if you think about it, you could add some very wise and insightful guidance to the situation, and speaking out might not be such a bad idea. Deep emotions you may have been suppressing could resurface this week. Although getting through thoughts about a hurtful time in your past could be challenging, you are advised to work through this and to find clarity. Doing so will lift a weight from your shoulders and allow you to start fresh. Someone has been less-than-honest in a transaction that may have involved a profit. You can probably sense this, but you may be afraid to speak up for fear of being wrong. But you can certainly check this out below the radar before you choose to say anything. It would be a wise way to protect yourself.","interval":"2019w47","reqDate":"2019w47"}]}
