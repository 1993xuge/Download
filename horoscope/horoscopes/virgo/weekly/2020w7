{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"A talent of yours that you believe in, that has been overlooked by others, may land you in the spotlight this week. Even though this is old news to you, others may suddenly seem quite interested in what it is that you do so well, Virgo. Whether this is playing the piano, sketching, or some other talent such as being great with mathematics, someone may need your help and discover your gift. Bravo, Virgo! This could add dimension to certain relationships because you are usually understated, and your gifts will make you stand out from the crowd. By the middle of the week, someone may ask you to get involved in an argument and to mediate because no one else can seem to clear things up. While this is not your favorite thing to do, your practical way of looking at things and at life in general could help diffuse the situation and help others see the big picture more clearly. Don't hesitate to help, for you will be the hero when things are resolved. You may also be called upon at work or among a group to solve a problem that is perplexing everyone. This may be easily solvable for you because of your aptitude for certain problems. If you are being pressed to answer a question or make a decision that you do not feel ready to make, don't force yourself. Forcing yourself to think about it will only stress you out. Relax and allow the answer to come to you when you are ready.","interval":"2020w07","reqDate":"2020w07"}]}
