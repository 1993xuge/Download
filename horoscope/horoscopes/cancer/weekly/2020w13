{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"When you watch an especially dark movie or read an especially dark book that dwells in a dark place such as heinous crime or utopian doom and gloom, it can certainly have an effect on your emotional well-being. Spending too much time immersing yourself in sad or scary scenarios is definitely not the most productive thing to do. But the good news, Moonchild, is that if this is just a movie, TV show, or a book, you can simply change the channel, stop the movie, or put the book away. It isn't always quite as easy when the world around you seems to be in disarray, but it is certainly possible. This week, if you have been overwhelmed by any of the negative going-ons that surround you in the real world, recognize that you have a strong enough mind and will yourself to tune it out, or if you can then go to your happy place - either physically or in your thoughts. News that travels to you this week from a distance may have changed a bit since it started out, much like the game of \"telephone.\" In that game, one person at a party whispers something in someone's ear, and that person whispers into the next person's ear, and so on. By the time the message leaves the end of the line it is dramatically different. Don't believe everything you hear until you check it out for yourself.","interval":"2020w13","reqDate":"2020w13"}]}
