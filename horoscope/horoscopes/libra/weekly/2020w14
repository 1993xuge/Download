{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Although you may be feeling rather bold this week, Libra, it would be wise to keep any controversial or revolutionary thoughts or ideas to yourself. Even if you fully believe in what you are thinking about, bringing up a complicated subject could subject you to criticism that you aren't ready to deal with. This week just work through your thoughts and ideas and refine them. Then if you want to raise certain issues later on, you will be better prepared, and you will be able to express yourself in a more fluid and organized way. A last-minute offer may come to you leaving you to feel like you are thought of as a last resort. But that really doesn't matter one way or the other. If this is an opportunity that interests you, it could bring greater security to your life, and it may involve using your talents in a way that will build your confidence and give you quite a lot to be proud of. Don't allow your principles to be your downfall. A highly regarded authority may have a different opinion than you do about something important. That does not automatically mean you are wrong. Hopefully you realize this and stand by your beliefs this week if a debate ensues.","interval":"2020w14","reqDate":"2020w14"}]}
