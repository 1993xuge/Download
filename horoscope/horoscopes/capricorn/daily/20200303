You may have questions and doubts now about what someone with power or authority is asking you to do, Capricorn. Don't feel bad about questioning what someone in authority position is asking you to do. Don't just assume that they must be right and know what they are doing and therefore if you disagree you must be wrong. Don't ever be afraid to question anything if it doesn't feel right. Let your inner voice speak up. Even if it turns out that you were uninformed and the decisions made were right, you still have the right to question and to know.","interval":"20200303","reqDate":"20200303"}]}
