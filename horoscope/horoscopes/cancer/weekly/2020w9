Make a wish for something that is very important to you, and try to imagine your wish floating high above you and being received among the stars. You have a great chance of making a dream come true right now, and the positive forces of the universe are there waiting to assist you with this. Don't question if it is likely to happen or how it could happen - just believe that it will! You may have tried on a pair of rose-colored glasses so that you could look at an unlikely relationship or business venture in a more positive light.

And if you waste your time on flimsy opportunities now, you may miss out on something really good that is coming your way around the same time. Be realistic, and you will see that there is a strong possibility for a change in your life that you have been waiting for. Even if you have been losing hope for happiness where your love life is concerned, this week you may have a change of heart. Things are looking up for you now. Whether you are in a relationship that could be better, or you haven't found the right one, you may soon begin to see new and exciting possibilities.
