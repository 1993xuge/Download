{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Your social life could pick up significantly this week, Moonchild, and that might be music to your ears. You may have felt a bit bored and out of touch in recent weeks, but when others come calling to drag you out of your shell you should heed your need to get out and about and to socialize. If you are a single crab, you may even meet someone who could play an important role and become very special in your life. But even for those people of your sign who are attached, this could be the boost you need to get back into circulation and networking with others who share your interests and maybe even make a new friend or two. You may have had some challenges with self-esteem recently, and this week could also serve to boost your sense of self-worth not just through the increase in social interaction, but also because you may be sought out by someone who finds your particular talents quite intriguing. This could lead to a money-making opportunity. If you find yourself feeling like you are in a lull toward the end of the week, try to resist using retail therapy to pull yourself out. You need to find a more stable and therapeutic way to deal with this feeling - one that can be used as a calming influence in the future as well. For example, getting into the habit of doing meditation could be a great way to go.","interval":"2020w04","reqDate":"2020w04"}]}
