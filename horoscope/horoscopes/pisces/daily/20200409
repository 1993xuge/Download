{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"One of the advantages of living in this modern time is that we can communicate daily, if we wish, with people who live very far away from us, or people that we wouldn't ordinarily have the chance to visit. We can visit them virtually and stay connected. But don't underestimate the value of an actual phone call, or even a hand-written letter. Even if you can't visit a loved one now, that kind of personal contact is essential to maintaining a strong and loving bond. If you find yourself thinking of someone today, Pisces, reach out in a more personal way to hear their voice and let them hear yours. You will be appreciated for it. Today would also be a good day to exercise your communication skills and talents.","interval":"20200409","reqDate":"20200409"}]}
