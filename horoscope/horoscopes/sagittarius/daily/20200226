{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Young children are not easily embarrassed because they have not yet learned about all of the social expectations, and within their innocence, they aren't worried about being laughed at. If a child walks into a room with his shirt on backwards, for example, it's no big deal. An adult, in a similar situation though, would probably be a bit embarrassed. The point is, Sagittarius, that you need to be more childlike in the way you see yourself. Don't get stuck in judging yourself or treating yourself harshly. Find humor and something to learn from in your mistakes instead.","interval":"20200226","reqDate":"20200226"}]}
