{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"A relationship that has long been established as a casual or peripheral friendship could slowly begin to change into something bigger and better this week. This may mean you will learn something new about each other that can be quite intriguing, and it may lead to a deeper friendship or spark a romance if both of you are free. Proceed slowly and with care, for you may already have expectations, and you need to be sure they are realistic. This week may also bring thoughts of reconciling an old grudge.

It is time to move on and heal. You may have the desire to escape a commitment you made recently, which you entered into without knowing all that you should have known. However, Gemini, this could create hurt feelings, and that is definitely something you need to consider. Perhaps you can fulfill your promise but also announce that you won't continue beyond that.","interval":"2020w17","reqDate":"2020w17"}]}
