For example, if you won something and there was just one prize, it means that everyone else didn't win it. But does that mean they lost something? No, not winning something is not necessarily the same as losing. And even if it can be considered a loss, for all you know, Scorpio, \"losing\" this could actually be a blessing in disguise.
