{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may feel like you aren't getting a whole lot done right now, Virgo. That may be because you only have a partially full schedule with lots of room and time to think and plan. So, instead of filling that time up and working through multiple tasks, you are just fretting over them. But when you stay busy - moving from one task to another - you will get a lot more done. So, it isn't that you don't have the time to do everything you have to do; it's that you have too much time and you aren't recognizing it. Make a schedule and stick to it. The busier you stay, the more you will do.","interval":"20200105","reqDate":"20200105"}]}
