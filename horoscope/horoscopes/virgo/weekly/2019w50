{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"A long-term goal could preoccupy your thoughts this week, Virgo. This is something you have taken out and dusted off now and then, but you have always put it right back on the shelf. This week is a great time to make some actual plans and take the first few steps to making this happen. Anything constructive you do this week in this regard will ensure a fruitful ending no matter how long it takes to accomplish. You may be so nervous about a present endeavor that you keep imagining it as a failure. You can see it going wrong in your mind, and you may mistake that for intuition about an upcoming failure - but it is not. You need to just dive into the work and try to enjoy the experience. If you remain present in the moment, you will fly through this joyfully and successfully. The universe may have a plan for you that you are not aware of. You keep receiving signs about something you should explore, though you may not be able to figure out why. Try looking into this and see if there is some interest. This may be a part of the design for your life, so don't give up until an answer appears to you. You may benefit from a brief retreat if you experience a harsh conversation late in the week. Someone who pushes your buttons could get to you, but if you seek solace in solitude, you will find your balance easily.","interval":"2019w50","reqDate":"2019w50"}]}
