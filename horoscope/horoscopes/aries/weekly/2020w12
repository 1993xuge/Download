{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"As you enter this week, Aries, you may be keenly aware that things are going quite well for you. Things are working out as never before - or at least for a long, long time. But as everything falls into place and positive possibilities begin to develop all around you, you are also quite aware that there is one small but nagging issue that you can't seem to overlook or resolve. It's as if a dirty fly has landed on your beautifully frosted cake. But that is only a perception, and not necessarily your reality. Do your best this week to focus on all that is going well in your life right now, and you may find that that one irritation will simply vanish when you stop worrying about it. An issue related to technology that has bugged you in recent weeks may be one of those things that start to work out well for you this week. Something was amiss, but either the right assistance will appear, or the problem will begin to have no relevance - and that will be a huge relief. This is a great week for a makeover of your office, your home, or even yourself. If you are looking to spruce something up for a fresher, more dynamic feel, then go for it in the days ahead. Start planning and designing, and you may find that your muse is more than eager to assist.","interval":"2020w12","reqDate":"2020w12"}]}
