But in reality, Aquarius, you do have choices, but you may not like the choices that you have. However, there is a certain amount of power present in being able to choose at all and in being able to make the most out of the choice you do make. Because from there, you can develop what you have chosen into something that is much better. Cultivate an attitude of gratitude, rather than one of resentment.","interval":"20200124","reqDate":"20200124"}]}
