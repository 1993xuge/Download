But just because someone is in the limelight and being paid a hefty sum for what they do for a living does not make them experts on anything in particular. The same translates to people in positions of authority in our own lives. This week, Gemini, you may experience someone like this who claims to know more than you do, even though they don't. If you feel as though you are in a position where you have to agree, but it bothers you, then don't be afraid to speak up. As long as you do so intelligently and politely, you will be admired for your honesty. In various television shows and movie sequels, an episode often ends in a cliffhanger or with an open question. It leaves you wanting more and ensures that you will come back to watch the next episode or the next movie in the sequel. Someone may try to use a similar ploy on you to manipulate you into something. Forewarned is forearmed. Look out for it, but as long as you are aware of it, you will remain in control.","interval":"2020w13","reqDate":"2020w13"}]}
