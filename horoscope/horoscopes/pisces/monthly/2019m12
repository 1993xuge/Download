{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"There may be a serious imbalance of power in one of your primary relationships, Pisces. This may not be a mean or argumentative relationship; it may just be that someone seems to think they know what's best for you, and they are always pushing their agenda on you. This month though, this needs to change. But it can only change if you choose to make that happen. You do know that calling your own shots would be a lot healthier for you, and coming out of your cocoon to take on the world is what you really need to do now. Don't be afraid to come out into the sun and explore who you are and what you want out of life. You may attract quite a lot of attention this month during a social gathering. Although you may feel shy about this at first, allow yourself to dazzle, and to just be yourself could draw in someone very special. If you are single, this could be a potential romantic partner. If you are not looking for love though, this could simply be a great connection that can help you make your life better in some way. You may feel that you have reached a plateau with a big effort. This may be dismaying because you really wanted to climb higher in a certain pursuit. But just when you are feeling resigned to not getting everything you want; you may discover a new way to ascend to a much higher level. Don't let anything stop you this month, because if you try, the universe will be there to support you and to lift you up.","interval":"2019m12","reqDate":"2019m12"}]}
