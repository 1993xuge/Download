{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Love is in the air. Or is it? That may be one of the main questions on your mind right now, dear Aries. It is, after all, the month when Valentine's Day spins around - and when things are going well in your love life, it can be quite a romantic time. Whether you are single or attached, this could be a really great month for you romantically, even if February does not start out that way. There may be some squabbles over mostly trivial things with a significant other, but before the 14th rolls around, you should be able to happily resolve them. And planning something special with your lover would be a wonderful and most pleasant experience. If you are single and looking, there could be a few attractive prospects who will catch your eye. This month may also bring you good fortune in the form of a windfall or a bonus for hard work you have done over the past months. It could also bring about a chance to advance yourself in some way financially that involves either an investment or a promotion, or maybe even taking on new business in a private venture. The month may get quite busy for you just past the middle of the month when some big project requires your attention, and you may have to juggle a lot of things at once. But with your high energy and attention to detail, this is something you will handle easily - for you will be in your element.","interval":"2020m02","reqDate":"2020m02"}]}
