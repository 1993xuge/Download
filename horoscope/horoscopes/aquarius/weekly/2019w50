{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"This week, Aquarius, someone may be very reliant on you to provide the correct answer for something they are struggling with. That's quite a lot of responsibility for something you can't necessarily control, and so it could be a big burden. If you wish to help, then you should, but do make it clear that you can't guarantee accuracy, even though you will certainly do your best. You will probably have a pretty clear set of plans for the entire week, but you may have to improvise at least a few times when unexpected events occur. This may involve family or work-related surprises that come up out of the blue, and setting aside your schedule to take charge with whatever needs your attention will be the best way to go. If you are patient and flexible, you should be able to accomplish everything you plan to accomplish with just a bit of compromise. This could be a great week for your relationships. This could mean a breakthrough with someone who has remained stoic in expressing their emotions. It could also translate into a renewed connection with someone from whom you got estranged. But your relationships, in general, could be pleasingly mellow and easy this week, so enjoy the companionship of those you care about the most. A wish you made some time ago may emit a glimmer of hope this week as you make a connection that could put you closer to making it come true.","interval":"2019w50","reqDate":"2019w50"}]}
