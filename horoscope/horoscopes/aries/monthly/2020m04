{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Life could be very dull without a little bit of drama. And if anyone is capable of handling drama, Aries, it would be you. You have a stabilizing presence because of your own strong sense of willpower and surefooted responsiveness to any kind of trouble. You are determined to get things back on track whenever life goes off the rails, and this provides a sense of security to those who inhabit your world. The drama you can expect this week could have something to do with a relationship and\/or a family matter, but you can handle it properly - just be sure that you don't lose your temper. Leave the room and count to ten if you must. A fractured relationship may be on your mind in April, but taking action right away may not be the most appropriate way to go. Mull over what you are perplexed by, and try to figure out the other person's perspective before you say anything. There may be aspects of a conflict that you had not even considered that will be extremely important if you want to reconcile and remain on good terms. A work-related matter could pop up more than once this month - the same matter that seems to keep resurfacing. Could it be that you have been following someone else's solution, even though it hasn't worked time after time? If so, it may be time to come up with your own creative solution. You are more than capable.","interval":"2020m04","reqDate":"2020m04"}]}
