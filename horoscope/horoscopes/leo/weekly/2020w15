{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"It is important for you to start making financial plans and dealing with issues related to security this week - especially related to your home, your personal life, and the ones that enhance your financial situation. You are good at all of these things, Leo, but you may have not been as attentive as usual in recent weeks or even months. But once you sit down and start to take charge again, you will begin to feel more secure and more certain of your future. It won't take much to get back on track. Remaining patient and in charge of your emotions will be essential for you this week, as you may have to deal with someone who really raises your ire. Concentrate on being polite and respectful, even if you feel like lashing out. This is not the time to become emotionally volatile, and keeping your feelings in check will give you a strong advantage to resolve any ongoing issues in the most desirable way. You may feel eager to enter into some kind of negotiation or contract now, but it may have to wait. Instead, just get yourself prepared so that you have all the answers when the time is right.","interval":"2020w15","reqDate":"2020w15"}]}
