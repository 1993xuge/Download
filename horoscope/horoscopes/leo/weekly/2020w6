{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Someone could catch you off guard or startle you with a question that you see as nosy or intrusive. You are someone who can stand your ground and refuse to share personal information if that is your choice, but you may be angry that this person has the nerve to tread on your territory. The best advice you can receive this week is to \"not sweat the small stuff,\" as this will likely turn out to be small indeed. Just refuse to share and let it go. This is not important enough for you to lose sleep over, dear Leo. You may find yourself in a highly creative state of mind this week with your imagination coming up with more than a few brilliant ideas. Engaging in some sort of creative expression could help you balance out your emotions this week, and you may dream up something that could become lucrative if you keep that in mind and find a way to apply it. You may find yourself feeling uncharacteristically shy this week when you cross paths with someone that you find quite impressive. Whether this is a person you are attracted to romantically, or someone whose talents you admire, engaging in a conversation that showcases your interests can open up some wonderful dialogue. Don't miss the chance to have an eye-opening exchange with someone you can learn something from. Late in the week, there may be some news to celebrate. This could be related to a past failure that turned around completely, which will be all the more reason to acknowledge it.","interval":"2020w06","reqDate":"2020w06"}]}
