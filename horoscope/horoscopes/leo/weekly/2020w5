{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Someone's extreme determination may collide with your sense of privacy about an important matter this week, Leo. You may not want to talk about this issue, but someone might keep pushing you to the point of exhaustion. If you really feel that maintaining your silence on this is best for you, then you need to be just as assertive in your refusal. However, take a few minutes to think it over first. If sharing this with someone might help you in some way, then consider talking it over. A reassuring message from a loved one will help you recognize that you did the right thing with a family matter or a friendship, which will validate your choices and bring you a great sense of relief. Your career, a business deal, or a monetary transaction may wind up in focus this week. There may be a negotiation involved or simply a discussion about how to go about making a change or reaching for something you want. This may seem intimidating to you, but you should be able to find the capable guidance that you need to get this done right. A desirable new role may pop up for you among a group you belong to, or possibly at work. While you may feel hesitant at first about the time involved and the level of responsibility when you have so many other things to do, this could be very good for you. Think about it.","interval":"2020w05","reqDate":"2020w05"}]}
