{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You cannot allow an assumption to morph into a concrete idea of what is to come, Libra. If you give too much credence to a fear or a worry, then you will wind up proceeding as though it were a fact, when it is not, and may never be a fact. Instead, you need to consider all of the possible problems or glitches and find ways to work around them - but do not assume these are going to be your downfall. You have the power now, and as long as you navigate based on strategy rather than fear, you will prevail.","interval":"20200103","reqDate":"20200103"}]}
