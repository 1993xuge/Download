{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Sprucing up your home may be a great project for you for the month of February, Leo. If you have been feeling a bit glum or just in need of a change, moving around the furniture, painting the walls in inspiring hues, and maybe adding a few accent pieces of smaller furniture or other items of home decor could give you a feeling of being refreshed and reinvigorated. This doesn't have to cost a lot, and it could be quite fun making choices and putting yourself to work. You might even want to include a special creative friend to help. Public speaking or a presentation of some kind may wind up on your schedule this month. You may have something important to convey, so getting as thoroughly prepared as you can will give you a considerable boost of confidence. You are a natural speaker. With your constant charm, your way with words, and likable nature, others are drawn to you anyway. And when you are deeply knowledgeable of the subject matter, you will command your audience. You may also want to host some kind of an event this month. This could be anything from a family gathering to an intimate dinner for friends, to something bigger for a charitable cause. You can be a party animal when you are in the mood, so enlist some help so that you can not only be well-prepared, but you will be able to enjoy the time without worrying about running the show.","interval":"2020m02","reqDate":"2020m02"}]}
