{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may be super sensitive right now, Libra. Usually, you are far more balanced in your perceptions, but you could be feeling anxious empathy for someone in your life who is facing a struggle or you may be involved in some other unbalanced situation which throws you off; and therefore, your perception may be a bit off. You may take a compliment as false flattery. You may perceive a suggestion as a criticism. Lighten up in the way you see and perceive what happens around you. Recognize that you may be a bit more agitated than usual and not in the right frame of mind to be as realistic as you typically are. Assume everything is meant positively, and accept that as reality. This will allow you to be happier and not overreact accidentally.","interval":"20200403","reqDate":"20200403"}]}
