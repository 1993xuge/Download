If you were to try to make a sloth move quickly, it just would not work because it isn't within its nature to do so. Your inner peace is not as stable right now, so you can be easily disturbed and annoyed with someone during these times. You may wish that someone in your life was different in some way, Libra, but are you sure this isn't just a part of their nature that isn't going to change? We all have elements in our makeup that are just a part of who we are. If you care about them, you need to accept them fully and make adjustments. And you should accept nothing less from someone who loves you!","interval":"20200412","reqDate":"20200412"}]}
