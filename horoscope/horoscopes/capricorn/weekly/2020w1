{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"If you find yourself in the doldrums this week, Capricorn - which is something that many people experience this time of year - then do some splurging on yourself. Take yourself shopping, or visit the salon for a day of pampering with a facial or a new hairstyle. Whatever you choose to do, make sure it is something that will help you relax and look and feel your best. Something so simple really can redirect your outlook and change your perception. This should not only uplift your mood, but it would also boost your confidence. Toward the middle of the week, you may find yourself waking up in the morning with a wonderfully optimistic attitude. That's because you can feel the vibrations changing and good energy swirling around you. Good things are happening, though at this time only behind the scenes, but this bodes well for the times ahead on the horizon. This is a great week to contemplate the year ahead and to look back on lessons, positive experiences, and the dreams you had that may have materialized in the year that is now behind us. As you assess where you are, you will have a clearer idea of where you want to go and how to get there.","interval":"2020w01","reqDate":"2020w01"}]}
