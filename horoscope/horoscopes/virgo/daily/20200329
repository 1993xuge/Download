If things work out as you envision they will, you will probably be satisfied, Virgo. But what if they don't? It is best to treat a relationship like a journey. The only expectations you should have are to be treated respectfully, fairly, and kindly. But if you have a very specific idea of how things need to play out, you need to remember that that is only your interpretation and only your expectation. Allow the road ahead to unfold naturally, and you will find it far more enjoyable.","interval":"20200329","reqDate":"20200329"}]}
