{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Someone's constant demand for attention may be sapping not just your energy but also your peaceful state of mind. This may be someone who has always come off as rather emotionally needy, even though they may have a lot going for them. This week, you might try a different approach to dealing with this person since past efforts have always led to the same results. If you refuse to help directly but encourage them from the sidelines, you can help them build up their own confidence and rely less on you, Moonchild. You are well-known for your empathy and your sensitive nature, but this week someone could try to take advantage of that by luring you into a project you don't really want to take on. Or perhaps this is something you have space in your heart for - but not time on your agenda. Be strong and say no if the timing is wrong. You could always take a raincheck and get involved later. If you are looking to increase your income, this is a perfect week to begin exploring something that has been on your mind for a long time. This is a way to make money that you have not taken advantage of, but it could wind up being very successful for you. In addition, you may also find that an unrelated windfall is making its way to you. It may arrive this week, but if not, look for it in the very near future.","interval":"2020w12","reqDate":"2020w12"}]}
