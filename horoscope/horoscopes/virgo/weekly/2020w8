{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"At the very beginning of this week, Virgo, you need to set your sites on what is most important to you right now, even if it is a very big goal, and even if you aren't really in the mood to do so. There could be some big developments in the week ahead that will lift your spirit and open up a window or two of opportunity that could allow you a great head start on getting this done. If you aren't prepared, though, these windows of opportunity could close before you get through, so make sure to be ready. A lost cause - or a cause that you thought was lost - could be revived this week by someone else. Don't be shy about this. Jump right in if you feel compelled to do so. You may be able to team up with someone who feels as passionate about a certain cause as you do, and you may complement each other in many ways, with you making up for their weaknesses and vice versa. You could become a dynamic duo if you give this a chance. Your response to someone's temper tantrum this week could easily result in an all-out conflict. This may be a repeat of something that happened with a volatile individual in the past, but you can prevent yourself from making the same mistake again if you remain aware of it. If you handle this in a dignified fashion, you will walk away knowing you did the right thing and also feeling really good about it.","interval":"2020w08","reqDate":"2020w08"}]}
