{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You are easily influenced by the environment you are in, Pisces. You pick up vibes and feel the emotions of others very easily. You do this without even trying. You are by nature an empath, so when others around you are in pain or turmoil, or when they experience anxiety because of whatever is going on in the world or in their lives, you actually feel it all too, at least to some degree. That's why it is especially important for you to make time each day to \"reset\" your emotional equilibrium. Doing so will ensure that you can handle anything and that you can always welcome happiness into your life.","interval":"20200320","reqDate":"20200320"}]}
