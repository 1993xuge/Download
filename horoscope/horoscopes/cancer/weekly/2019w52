{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Being clear and very direct in expressing how you feel, what you need, and what you want will be your key to a good mood this week and smoothness in all of your relationships. You are someone who withdraws into the background when you aren't feeling sure of yourself, or when you are unhappy but afraid of asking for a change for fear of disrupting things. But this week, Moonchild, that will be easier for you, and you need to take advantage of that welcoming energy by communicating your deepest thoughts and emotions. This will go very well for you if you persevere. You may have a complaint that you would like to voice to a boss, a partner, or someone who is doing some work for you. Since communication is emphasized for you this week, this is a perfect time to say what's on your mind. However, you will get the best results if you blend all of your complaints in with some flattery and praise. This will soften the blow and cause someone to take you more seriously. Someone in your life has been making a serious promise that so far has not been fulfilled. Even so, you may keep making excuses for this person. Actions speak louder than words, though, so it may be time to discount those promises if no steps are taken to fulfill whatever was promised. You have nothing to lose at this point by drawing a hard line in the sand.","interval":"2019w52","reqDate":"2019w52"}]}
