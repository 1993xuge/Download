{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"This week, Leo, you may be very skeptical about someone's motives or their general honesty. But if you do feel that way, do your best not to show it. If you were to show your hand in this situation, you could clue in the person you do not trust, which will allow them to alter and adjust their approach to better hide their true motives. Be a fly on the wall instead. Don't react in any dramatic way. Just observe and learn, and you will either validate or free yourself of a fear. You may be facing an irritating problem that has carried into this week from last week or even before. You may not want to deal with it because you feel that if you just ignore it, then it will go away - but it won't. You need to look at this issue in a constructive way. Try to see this problem as an education. As you work through it, you are learning and becoming better equipped to deal with similar issues in the future, so they don't become problems. When you graduate from this lesson, you will be wiser and more powerful. A money matter that has caused a rift or a misunderstanding can be resolved this week if you approach it with patience and you don't make any assumptions. This could be about advice that went wrong, a loan, or miscommunication, but if you approach it fairly, hearing out another party, you can come to an understanding. The weekend may heat up quickly with a last-minute invitation you will want to say yes to.","interval":"2019w49","reqDate":"2019w49"}]}
