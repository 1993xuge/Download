{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"There is someone in your life who keeps you on your toes, Pisces, but you may not fully realize how very important this person is to your growth and confidence. This person may act as someone who pushes your buttons or who brings up controversial issues that you don't really want to deal with, but because this all happens, you have grown better and stronger and more confident in yourself over time. If a conflict erupts with this person this week, you need to keep all of this in mind. Recognizing how important this person is to you is very important. And what's even more important right now is letting this individual know that you can see their value in your life. You may have been trying to summon the courage to make a bold move toward an opportunity. This week, something someone says to you, or some kind of recognition for something you have accomplished should give you the boost you need to be as bold as you have to be. Taking this step will be instrumental in achieving a long-standing goal. A mental block about getting something done could begin to lift this week. You have struggled to deal with a complicated issue - perhaps related to a family matter - but you should begin to see things more clearly, which will lead you to find a way to raise the issue with key players in a most satisfactory way.","interval":"2020w04","reqDate":"2020w04"}]}
