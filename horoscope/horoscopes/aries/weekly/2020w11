{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"A ritzy caf\u00e9. A posh and sumptuous dinner. A dazzling companion. Sparkling conversation. Will all or any of these things be a part of your experience in the week ahead? They may be. Then again, maybe not. But does it matter, Aries? You can have fun no matter where you are, no matter what you do, and no matter who you spend the time with. But sometimes you want things to go so precisely according to a certain plan or guideline that you lose sight of all the potential fun you could be having if you would just loosen your grip, relax, and enjoy. That's your assignment for this week - to loosen up and enjoy a bit more spontaneity. This week could also bring you a boatload of confidence as someone praises or recognizes you with honor for something you accomplished. And it should not matter whether that accomplishment was recent or long ago. The most important thing to see is that you made a big impact. Allow yourself to feel proud of that. You are not someone who often dances to the behest of a different drummer. You like order. You like to have a plan. And you like to work within certain restrictions that give you a sense of confidence. But sometimes, if you have an idea that others may not understand, you have to be brave and follow that idea wherever it leads you. If this occurs for you this week, then follow your muse. Later in the week, don't take the bait if someone entices you into an argument. When you argue, you go full force, and it can be a difficult thing to come down from. You are more in need of peace and harmony than debate skills. Choose serenity.","interval":"2020w11","reqDate":"2020w11"}]}
