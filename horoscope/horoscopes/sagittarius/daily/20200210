{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"On some days, for no apparent reason, it is simply harder to get out of bed feeling hopeful and happy. And even if the sun is shining, it may seem impossible to think sunny thoughts, which is all the more reason to be determined to do so anyway, Sagittarius. If you are having one of those days, turn your thoughts to all the many wonderful elements of your life and be grateful for them. These things may range from your own talents to people in your life that you love that you feel happy to have in your world. There is always something that can put a smile on your face. And putting a smile on your face can subsequently turn your day around.","interval":"20200210","reqDate":"20200210"}]}
