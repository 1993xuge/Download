{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may find yourself wanting to burrow under the covers many days this week or sit on the sofa wrapped in a cozy throw blanket. This is not your usual style, Aries, but you may be craving comfort and serenity now more than ever. Should you indulge in this need to build a nest and retreat from the world? Absolutely! You work hard and play hard, and if this is what you are feeling right now, then this is what you need right now. Too much of this, of course, might not be good for you, but a night here and there in your warm pajamas and some time to kick back will be good for you. This week may also bring a bit of frantic activity on the work front - whether within the role of your job, or with some project you started at home or in your community. This should balance out your quiet times quite nicely because you are someone who needs to remain active. Just be careful this week about not getting into a personality clash with another strong-headed person. If there is someone you know to be difficult and argumentative, you could go into any exchanges expecting a problem, and you know what they say about self-fulfilling prophecies. So, if that begins to occur, just breathe and count to ten or leave the room for a little while if necessary. You can cap off the week with some sort of achievement or recognition for something you are quite proud of, and yes - this does call for a celebration, so make the most of it.","interval":"2020w06","reqDate":"2020w06"}]}
