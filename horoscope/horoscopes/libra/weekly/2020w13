{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"What is the difference between abundance and wealth? That depends on your own perception. Abundance can mean having all that you need in terms of food, water, and shelter. It can also mean having a lot of love and friendship in your life. Wealth usually relates to your financial situation, but you can be an abundant person too if your life is rich with all of the above and not material wealth. If you are contemplating this in the week ahead and aspiring to more in your life, start looking around you and appreciating what you do have without comparing it to what you don't have. You will be richer in many ways if you do this. It will even draw in greater possibilities in every area of your life, Libra. You may feel that you are on the brink of a big change this week. Although it may not be clear what is about to change for you, you can feel something coming. And you are right. Positive change is washing into your life now. But don't be afraid - there will be doors opening, but you can choose to travel through only those that you find appealing.","interval":"2020w13","reqDate":"2020w13"}]}
