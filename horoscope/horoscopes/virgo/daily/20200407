You probably wouldn't notice it very much until you took your shoe off at the end of the day when the pain caused your feet to throb. When we get used to something that isn't quite right, we tend to develop some level of avoidance until the issues become so obvious that they are a problem. Something may not be quite right with something you are now dealing with, Virgo, but if you correct it in a timely manner, there will be no long-term adverse effects. You have the opportunity to fix this now.","interval":"20200407","reqDate":"20200407"}]}
