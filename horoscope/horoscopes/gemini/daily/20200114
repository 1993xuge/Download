{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"A certain thought, longing, or regret is taking up a lot of space in your life. You may wonder how such a thing could take up space, Gemini, but it certainly can. That's because it crowds out other more positive thoughts, desires, and feelings of fulfillment. It can become addictive, and there is nothing beneficial about it.
