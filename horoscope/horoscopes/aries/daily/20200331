Even though you may be worlds apart in your views, and you may have very different backgrounds and experiences, that doesn't mean you can't find a meaningful connection. There may be something there now that you can learn from each other, and that's always positive. The more diverse your world is, the more you become a true citizen of the earth. By broadening your horizons, you are broadening your opportunities, Aries.","interval":"20200331","reqDate":"20200331"}]}
