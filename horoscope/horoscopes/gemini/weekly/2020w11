{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"This is a great week for initiating a project that involves teamwork. What's that, Gemini? Does that sound a bit odd to you? If so, that may be because you flit around so quickly that you don't have time to partner up with others often enough, let alone be patient to gather someone else's input. But you may surprise yourself if you choose the right partner, and that chance may come to you this week. If you have a big project you have been contemplating, this could be the perfect opportunity to get it off the ground with someone who can understand your vision and complement your style. Don't hesitate to explore that possibility. With a family member, it will be all about quality time this week. Whether this is a neglected spouse, child, or even a friend, you may be able to carve out a few special moments to enjoy this person's company and to give them the validation and the reassurance they need to proceed with you. It is easy to alienate someone when you stop nurturing, so be very aware of that this week. You could encounter someone this week with a very special skill. And although you may be fascinated by this person's ability, you may not feel the need to learn whatever it is they could teach you. If given the chance, though, you should choose to learn anyway, as this may come in handy sooner than you think.","interval":"2020w11","reqDate":"2020w11"}]}
