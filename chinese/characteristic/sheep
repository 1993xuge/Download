They can also be the most creative and artistically talented and may be drawn to the spiritual or esoteric. They are intelligent, romantic, charming, compassionate, and gentle. Sheep always like to look their best and have a terrific sense of style. They flourish in an environment where they can work at their own pace, in spaces that are aesthetically pleasing, and surrounded by approval, love, and support. Sheep are also known as the most potentially vulnerable and needy sign.\u00a0", "Luckily, Sheep tend to attract whatever they need in life \u2013 including powerful allies, wealthy patrons, and patient and adoring friends and partners. They will do anything to support and show love for friends and family, but they should avoid smothering them with the amount of support and love that they require for themselves. Sheep can also be disorganized, lazy, pessimistic, timid, indecisive, anxious, gullible, secretive, bossy, and overly sensitive."]}, "success": true}
