{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You are an efficient and effective problem solver, Aries, because you have the ability to look at an issue from a distance, separate it into its parts, understand the people involved, and come up with a logical solution. It is your ability to distance yourself that allows you to see things in a more objective way than someone else might.

If you are having trouble relating to someone today, try a more empathic approach.","interval":"20200213","reqDate":"20200213"}]}
