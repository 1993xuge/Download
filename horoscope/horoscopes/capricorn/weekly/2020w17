{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Your popularity among a certain social group is beginning to peak, Capricorn. Over time, your occasionally shy personality has begun to shine, and others are starting to see you in your best light. This may mean more invitations and social events, but it might also mean that you will unwittingly invite more inquiries that you consider to be private. You are not always forthright in even your closest personal relationships, but this week you may have to become more comfortable with sharing your deeper thoughts as you may be engaged in interesting conversations where you will want to reveal more of who you are. You may find this to be surprisingly satisfactory. You have always believed that if you work hard enough for something, you will achieve it. But one of your bigger goals has not yet been fulfilled despite your great efforts and a lot of time and energy invested into it. You may be wondering if you should continue investing in this, but a sign you receive before the end of this week should provide the inspiration and motivation you need to continue.","interval":"2020w17","reqDate":"2020w17"}]}
