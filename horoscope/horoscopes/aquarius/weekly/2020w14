{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may be considering a joint business or money-making venture with someone who is also associated with you in a personal way. This may be a lover, a friend, or even a family member, Aquarius. Being a practical and logical person, you recognize that mixing business with pleasure can be incredibly risky, but if you go about it in the proper way, it can be wonderful. This week analyze all the possibilities and have a candid discussion with the other party. Recite your expectations, and hear out what the other person expects as well. If you define your roles thoroughly and precisely, there is no reason not to go down this road. A stellar attempt at reconciling with someone you have been at odds with may not guarantee a healed connection with this person - however, it could be the impetus that is needed to get someone thinking along this line, and it would be a wise thing to initiate. Leave well enough alone with an argument that seemed to go nowhere. You may have the urge this week to keep trying to prove a point, but it may be too soon to do so. Just let it go for now. Sometimes the best way to prove an important point is through demonstration rather than through debate.","interval":"2020w14","reqDate":"2020w14"}]}
