{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"This week may involve a negotiation that you have been putting off for far too long, Scorpio. You may have resisted opening up a discussion because you feared you would have to compromise too much to get what you really want. However, if you do begin to talk about this in the days ahead, you may find that your goals are more aligned with someone else's than you ever realized, which will mean that eventually there will be very little compromising. A productive dialog at your workplace or within some form of a partnership could lead to a new understanding and a wonderful breakthrough in communication with someone who has an important role in your life. Be mindful of how this transpired because your openness is what can lead to greater communication in your life. And although that is sometimes difficult for you, it is something you can evolve into if you give yourself the chance. You may have been trying to come up with an idea to improve some endeavor that isn't going as well as planned. It might be wise to initiate a brainstorming session with a few folks you admire. Even though you have many talents of your own, others in your world who have creative abilities might be able to come up with some ideas that will spur you on to even greater creative heights. Give it a try. Sometimes one idea leads to another and another until eventually, you come up with something that is just perfect.","interval":"2020w12","reqDate":"2020w12"}]}
