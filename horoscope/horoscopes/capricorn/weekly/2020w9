{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"A new relationship, whether it is a romance or a friendship could be causing you some stress - even though this is a good bond for the most part. This may be connected to a disagreement that you don't know how to interpret. But a clear and candid conversation is the best way to approach this, and this week you can clarify things to the point where everything feels right again. Don't be afraid to honestly say that you just don't understand, and that you do want to understand, Capricorn. Reasonable people appreciate that mindset. A transformative moment could occur this week when someone reveals something that was formerly secret or private and shows you how much they trust you and how much faith they have in you. Although you may have suspected whatever this person confides, you were respectful enough to give them the distance that was needed to process their thoughts. Kindness always has a powerful impact. A negotiation or an issue related to a contract could pop up around the middle of the week, and it may be aggravating. Handling this through a third party is advised if at all possible because you will want to be sure that everything is on the up and up and everyone is being objective about the facts. A conversation later in the week could be an eye-opener when someone reveals a heartfelt desire you had no idea about. This revelation will help you make sense of something that was quite perplexing.","interval":"2020w09","reqDate":"2020w09"}]}
