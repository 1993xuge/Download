{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"When we are surrounded by negative people, it can be hard to keep that gloomy energy at bay. When we hear others talk about how bad things are, or when they dwell on the latest scary news, it can be hard not to head down a fearful path in your own mind. We can't always avoid people like this, Virgo, but there is an antidote for those times when we are surrounded by negativity. Take a look at the beautiful world that's around you and count your many blessings. There is far more good around you than bad.","interval":"20200313","reqDate":"20200313"}]}
