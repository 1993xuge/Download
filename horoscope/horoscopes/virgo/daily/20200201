Logically we know this, but when we encounter someone who appears to have it all, we might not recognize that they may be in need of support and sympathy.

Don't make that assumption if you encounter someone like this, Virgo. Offering your kindness is never a bad way to go with anyone.","interval":"20200201","reqDate":"20200201"}]}
