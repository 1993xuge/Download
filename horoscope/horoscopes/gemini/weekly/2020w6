{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Someone in your life could overstay their welcome in your life this week, Gemini. You are not the most patient of people, and you do tend to become bored rather easily. So, when someone wants to just hang out and talk or spend afternoons idly gossiping over coffee, you would probably rather visit the dentist. However, if you could engage this person to try to enjoy whatever you happen to be doing at the moment, you might discover a fun partner in crime beneath the dull exterior. A new beginning is possible this week with a matter related to making money. There may be a project that got stalled that you may have thought was no longer viable, but something someone says or does this week could show you that you need to put this back on track. If you do, success could come easily - after a lot of the hard work you have already done, that is! The path this takes you down could be fascinating, and you could learn a thing or two that will be quite valuable to you in the future. Late in the week, you may feel as though you are standing in someone's shadow with an effort that you have put your heart and soul into. That is not a realistic fear, however. Your talents are being recognized, and you shall be noticed and acknowledged for your hard work, so let those thoughts go so that you can get as much out of the experience as possible.","interval":"2020w06","reqDate":"2020w06"}]}
