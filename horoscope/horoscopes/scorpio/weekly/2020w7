{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may have some professional or some money-related pressures this week that could be frustrating, and that will be resolved only by dealing with certain people. Although the experience might be irritating, you need to maintain your sense of humor as you work through this. If you do, you will not only feel better yourself, but those around you who are involved in any way will feel endeared to you and will want to help you out. This will lead to a good outcome. In fact, setting your worries aside in other areas of your life this week will make you feel better about everything. You may find that your enthusiasm is revving up this week for a plan you let slide recently. Perhaps you gave up because you lost interest or because you felt the idea was not viable at first. Taking this on again could be a good thing. Explore it. You can be very outgoing, Scorpio, but you are also very private at the same time. This could disrupt a social engagement you make this week if someone gets a bit too personal with the questions. But keep in mind that you are not being interrogated - you are just seen as an interesting person that someone would like to get to know. If you realize that you need to sleep in a few days this week, and you are able to do that, then you should. You may be feeling the tension and the fatigue from a few intense weeks, and if you need to replenish yourself, it is important to do so. Even if you can't sleep late, find a way to take a power nap or invest a few moments in meditation to relax yourself - mind, body, and spirit.","interval":"2020w07","reqDate":"2020w07"}]}
