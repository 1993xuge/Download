{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Unexpected money or good fortune in some other form could fall in your lap this week, Leo. Of course, it will be most welcome, as good fortune is always welcome. But you may be worried that there could be a few strings attached, especially if this comes from or through someone who is not usually so kind or generous. However, although there may be something to gain on the part of someone else, this will probably have no effect on you, so accept whatever good comes to you with grace and gratitude. You may find that you are a bit klutzier than usual. Most of the time you are agile and quick like the cat that is the symbol of your sign, but this week, you may be so preoccupied with distracting thoughts that you won't pay as much attention to where you are going. But this is nothing serious - just something to watch out for. You need to snap out of that distracted mood later in the week when you take on a big obligation that could win you new opportunities in the future. That should be easy for you, though, because you should find the subject matter quite interesting and involving. You might have to turn down an invitation to complete your mission, but it will be well worth it for this responsibility is something you should excel at, which will bring you positive attention. Your finesse in this matter should also help build your confidence in an area that will be quite important to either your career or to some interest that you see as much more than a hobby.","interval":"2020w07","reqDate":"2020w07"}]}
