{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may have a good chance this week to get an objective look at something that is holding you back. This may come through the casual observation of someone else, or through some struggle you see someone else is going through. Put this insight to work for you, and you can eliminate any roadblocks that stand in your way. By taking charge and making a few small changes, you can achieve huge results, dear Aquarius. Money may be on your mind this week - but it may not be about saving, but rather about spending. Is there a coveted item you would like to purchase? If you know deep down this is not a good time to spend on something big, make a small splurge instead and make plans for attaining what you want later on at a more opportune time. Your mind may also be on business this week, the acquiring of a big account, or expanding in some way. But before you take any big steps, you need to create a plan that is structured and easy to follow so that when you finally make your move, it is as smooth as possible. A lucky break could occur this week when a social meet-up or gathering could result in a great networking connection where you would least expect it. Don't turn this into business right away though; allow yourself to develop a social relationship that could lead to something more.","interval":"2019w52","reqDate":"2019w52"}]}
