{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Life is becoming easier for you now, Virgo, and this week you will begin to see signs of this. Does this mean that everything you have been working on will suddenly turn out perfectly? No, not quite. Does this mean that every relationship will be free of conflict? Not exactly. But the process of striving and working and experiencing your life will become more fluid and more rewarding, simply because you are feeling a greater peace surrounding you, and because you are feeling more comfortable in your own skin. This sense of spiritual harmony will serve you well around the middle of the week when a unique experience may become available to you. This will have a component of learning, evolving and exploring, but there could be some element of becoming ready to make your life more financially secure. Trust in your sixth sense later in the week when it seems to give you a warning. Don't automatically turn away from whatever this warning is about, but do take the time to explore it and figure out how to proceed. By the weekend, celebrate a friendship that is very special to you. This may be someone you have wished you could spend more time with - and that can happen if you choose to make the time!","interval":"2019w49","reqDate":"2019w49"}]}
