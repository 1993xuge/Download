{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Life is a glorious mystery. And although someone like you can enjoy the surprises life has in store, there are times when you become impatient to have an answer or to see more immediate progress when you have worked hard for something. This week, you may be feeling especially impatient, Aries, and that feeling may even be transforming into something of an obsession. But that will only make you feel crazy, as you know, and that's not good for your peace of mind. Try to distract yourself with pleasant diversions. Catch up on old business you have been putting off. Plunge into some hobby you have been hoping to engage in. Explore some interest you have been hoping to learn more about, or flip through a good book you have been wanting to read. There are many ways you can fill your time happily and productively. An excursion with a fun friend may wind up on your agenda this week. Say yes if the chance comes to you because it could be a great way to bond and to look into a partnership possibility with someone whose company you enjoy and whose intellect you respect. Late in the week, someone may come knocking for a surprise visit. If so, don't worry if the house is a bit messy or you happen to be wearing sloppy attire. Just enjoy the moment and don't stress out.","interval":"2020w05","reqDate":"2020w05"}]}
