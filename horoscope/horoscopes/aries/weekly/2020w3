{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may feel that you haven't put your heart and soul into things as much as you usually do, dear Aries. Either a monotonous schedule or some kind of disappointment has lulled you into a distant state of mind. Pulling yourself out of this mindset isn't complicated, but it will require dedication - and this week you need to do just that. Take special care to notice the details of your days. Notice the smiles you get from your kind words, the good things that happen when you put effort into even the most dull job, and the good luck that seems to come out of nowhere after you raise your hopes and your expectations. It is all about being mindful and present this week, and it will make a big positive difference for you now and throughout the year ahead. Make it a habit. You may find yourself in the mood to dress up and go out. Even though these thoughts might come to you early in the week when you can't get away for such an excursion, it's not too early to start planning an adventure just for yourself or with someone dear. This will give you something special to look forward to, so revel in the expectation. Someone in your life - perhaps a child or a younger person - may be clamoring for your attention this week, but possibly in a negative way. They may try to start an argument or raise an opinion that conflicts with yours. But instead of reacting negatively, give them the time and attention they need.","interval":"2020w03","reqDate":"2020w03"}]}
