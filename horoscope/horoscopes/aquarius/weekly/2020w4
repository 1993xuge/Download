{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"When a caterpillar first begins to emerge from its cocoon as a beautiful butterfly, the world may seem like a strange place. Now this creature has wings, but may not yet know how to use them. That may be a bit how you are feeling at the start of this week, Aquarius, but any fear or sense of being out of your element will fade and give way to a sense of power and control over your life. You may experience a kind of rebirth this week, so go forward knowing that everything is getting better and that you are becoming more powerful as you courageously face change. This is timed with some extraordinary events in your life that may seem understated at first. You may receive an offer that does not seem like it was cut out for you, but that may only be because you have not yet recognized your full potential. Keep this in mind and say yes to something that you find appealing, even if you don't yet feel confident enough to take it on. With a work assignment or a problem you inherited from someone else, you may have been dealt a bad hand. However, if you play it in the best way that you can, you may find that it was actually an advantage because you were underestimated by someone who is competing with you. Just remain confident and do your best, and you will eventually prevail.","interval":"2020w04","reqDate":"2020w04"}]}
