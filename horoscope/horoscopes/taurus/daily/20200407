{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"The restaurant business can be a very tough one. It involves long hours, the constant coming and going of good help, lots of competition, and the shelf life of ingredients can lead to losses if too much is purchased. It's a business that someone has to love passionately to become involved in, but for that person, it can be quite fulfilling. If someone does not understand your devotion to a dream of yours, Taurus, don't let it get to you. As long as you know what you are getting into and are ready to face the challenges - enjoy and savor the good pieces of the experience that bring you joy and satisfaction.","interval":"20200407","reqDate":"20200407"}]}
