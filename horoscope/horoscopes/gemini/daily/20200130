Once you have a sense of mistrust, it can be hard to overcome. So, Gemini, rather than challenging someone on whether they are being honest or not, do some research for yourself. Search around for objective information and resist making accusations, even if you feel pretty sure. You could ruin a relationship unnecessarily if you assume and accuse without proof. Your feelings may just be coming from anxiety that has nothing to do with the situation.","interval":"20200130","reqDate":"20200130"}]}
