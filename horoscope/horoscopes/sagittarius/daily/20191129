{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"The future is not an easy thing to pin down. In fact, even for someone with the gift of uncanny intuition, they won't have an intuition for everything and even for the things they do, a lot of times their intuition can be imprecise or even completely wrong. That's because things are dynamic. We can change and influence things, other people change things and our interactions with other people influence things. We all have the power to change what the future will bring based on what we do in the present. You may have a strong intuition about a future outcome. You may even see it as being etched in stone. But if it isn't to your liking, Sagittarius, start creating a plan to change it. The power to change the future is in your hands - and in the present moment.","interval":"20191129","reqDate":"20191129"}]}
