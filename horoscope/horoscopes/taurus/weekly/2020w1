{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may experience a sense of fate this week as someone appears in your life who can help you with something you have been struggling with or help answer a question, answer for which you have been searching for. This will seem like serendipity, and indeed it is, Taurus. Take it seriously and allow yourself to absorb and acknowledge this blessing from the universe. In recent weeks, it may have seemed that someone was keeping a secret from you. This may be someone who is usually quite open, so this would come to you as a surprise, which will make you even more curious. But don't push it, because if you do, you may get either a defensive lie or anger in return. Just let it be, and the truth will come to you soon enough. You may experience a wonderful collaboration this week either at work or with a personal project. You may find that you work so well with another person that you may consider partnering up again on other projects with this individual. And what comes of this collaboration may be quite impressive. The stars are urging you this week to pay attention to how you are feeling. If you are becoming overly tired, then take care of yourself by getting enough sleep and eating right. And most of all, keep stress to a minimum. You can keep tension at bay through exercise and meditation.","interval":"2020w01","reqDate":"2020w01"}]}
