{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You are someone who treasures your relationships and draws power from the positive connections in your life. A deep soul connection could be on your mind this week, Pisces, and that may be because there is a message you need to receive from a certain person. Time spent with this individual could revive you and restore your sense of balance and hope. Make plans to catch up with a friend or loved one who always helps you put life in perspective, and you will come away with a renewed feeling of optimism and ideas for making your future even brighter. If you are single, this could be a great week to meet a few potential romantic prospects. Love is in the air and social opportunities abound. So even if you are feeling like hiding away, force yourself to get out and about and allow the vibrant energy to fill you up with hope and laughter. The same applies even if you are already attached. Get out on the town with your mate and find ways to stir up those fiery feelings you have for each other. This is a great week to reconnect on a deeper spiritual level with your partner. You may have to make a personal decision that is very important this week, but you need to approach it in a business-like way. Doing this will help you see things more realistically and encourage you to do what's best for you.","interval":"2019w52","reqDate":"2019w52"}]}
