{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Is it really March already? Yes, indeed it is, Aries! And although it is often said that March comes in like a lion and goes out like a lamb, it might be the exact opposite for you. March may begin with a flurry of activity, including your completion of old business that might even have been hanging around from last year. This is a great time to tie up all loose ends of those stragglers so that you can concentrate on what you want to accomplish this month and throughout the year ahead. Because things should start out fairly slow at the beginning of the month, if you are organized and get down to business handling pre-existing matters, you can also spend some time doing some excellent planning for what lies ahead and setting goals that you want to aim for over the course of the coming months. You may meet someone who can assist you with at least one important goal by serving as a mentor or by simply being a source of great advice. A loving relationship that has been strained as of late may be on the mend this month. Tread carefully and don't bring up controversial issues until you are back on secure ground. As the pace picks up, sometime closer to the middle of the month, you may find yourself deluged with good opportunities, and your biggest problem may be in deciding which of these to pursue. That's not a bad problem to have. You may choose to engage with more than one of these great ideas, which will keep you both busy and fired up throughout the rest of the month and into the next. And even those you don't pursue can probably be put on the shelf for later in the year.","interval":"2020m03","reqDate":"2020m03"}]}
