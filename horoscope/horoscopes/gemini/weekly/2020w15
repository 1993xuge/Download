{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You are anything but antisocial, Gemini - in fact, you are often sought out by others socially because you are so interesting and so much fun. But this week, you may find yourself wanting to hide away, but not in a bad way. Perhaps you are feeling more introspective, and maybe there is something you want to think about deeply. This is a good week to devote time to that and to give yourself a break from any recent high-stress activities. Take a break and feel good about it. You may be very self-conscious about a project you want to get involved in. That may be because you don't have the training or education that others do, or perhaps you lack a lot of experience. But don't let that stop you because you happen to have a natural talent for this venture, and you should go into it recognizing that and feeling confident. You bring a lot to the table. Don't be hesitant to \"brag\" a little bit about one of your accomplishments if you meet someone who could be influential. It could open doors to a new opportunity.","interval":"2020w15","reqDate":"2020w15"}]}
