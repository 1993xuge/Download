{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"An upcoming opportunity may hold great appeal to you, Sagittarius. You can be quite ambitious, and this chance may bring that ambition out in full force. You would love to make it clear to someone how perfect this will be for you and how no one else could take this on in the stellar way that you can. At the same time, though, you don't want to appear boastful or self-centered and egocentric. You may see that as a risk if you tout the many reasons why you should be chosen for this chance. Just pretend you're your own public relations representative. Present your skills and talents in a professional manner, and no one will take it the wrong way.","interval":"20200318","reqDate":"20200318"}]}
