This may be because you have just entered into a new year, and you are feeling revved up and ready to go with the goal of making your life more secure and more successful. You can have a great leap in monetary gain this year, and planning for it should begin this week. Spend some time getting your thoughts in order, and you will be ready to launch your ideas in time to take advantage of upcoming opportunities. New responsibilities at work or with a partnership may start to come in.

One particular effort could yield an immediate positive result, and this should help you build your confidence, motivate, and inspire you. You may have a chance to express yourself to movers and shakers this week.
