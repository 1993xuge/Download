{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"When you know or you believe that someone does not like you, your natural reaction might be to become insulted and possibly angry and treat them in the same way you perceive they are treating you. Even though it might be in your nature to be genial, you might be harsh in that person's presence. But what if you are wrong? Or, what if you are right? If you are right, you would only be proving that you are the not-so-nice person they think you are. It is always wise to present your best self no matter the circumstances. You may have either misjudged or been misjudged. Whatever the case may be - strive to always be your best self, Aries.","interval":"20200401","reqDate":"20200401"}]}
