{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Many of the days this month will have a weekend vibe to them as fun can be found around every corner and with every activity you become involved with - even in your work life, and even in the chores you do on a daily basis. This could be because of someone new in your life who adds verve to every encounter, who keeps you laughing, and who also keeps you guessing, Virgo. Ordinarily, you are so straightforward that you are not someone who enjoys mysteries in your personal life, but this individual may be so intriguing that you will find their character quite titillating. A big leap forward with an old obligation that you have been putting off will give you the impetus you need this month to finally get it done. What a relief! This could give you the space and time you need in your life to take up something that is more appealing to you, and you may already have a few ideas. You could choose, at some point this month, to meet up with a \"virtual\" friend - someone from social media, perhaps, or someone you converse with via email or by phone for work or some other reason - either to socialize or to work on something that could become a new aspiration. Although you get along swimmingly in your virtual or remote communication, you may not have exactly the same connection in person, but be patient and keep trying. Someone in your life who enjoys bringing high drama to any situation may want you to team up on a project this month. If you like the idea but don't want the drama, you could make a clear agreement to avoid all that fuss and hope your wish is respected. The question will be whether or not it is important enough for you to take the risk.","interval":"2020m03","reqDate":"2020m03"}]}
