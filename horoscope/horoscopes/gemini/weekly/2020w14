{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Just because you are not in someone's physical presence does not mean that you can't communicate in a meaningful way, Gemini. This week take some time each day to reach out to someone you are missing, someone you have not seen in some time, or even someone you have been estranged from. Try old-fashioned letter writing, create a work of art you can share via skype, send someone a poem, or just get creative in some other way to express how you are feeling. This is a great week to slow down, think deeply, and reach out to other people who are the most meaningful in your life, but with whom you don't always take time to share how you feel. You may have spent some time trying to get a message to someone, but it has not been successful. You may have begun to wonder if your message was getting through, or if perhaps it was being ignored. This week, you may have not just the validation that your message got through, but you may also get the answer that you have been hoping for.","interval":"2020w14","reqDate":"2020w14"}]}
