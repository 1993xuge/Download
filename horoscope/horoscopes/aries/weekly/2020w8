{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"This week you may get an unflinchingly realistic view of a situation you are thinking about getting involved in, Aries. Although you may have been hoping for more information on this matter, what you see may be both inspiring and disappointing. And while it may be somewhat frustrating to work through, in the end you should be very happy that you were privy to such useful and helpful information, which will give you great insight on what will be best for you in the long run. A chance to chill and just kick back with good conversation may come to you early in the week when you least expect it. You may be able to catch up with an old friend or someone whose schedule usually clashes with yours. This break in the week could give you a burst of energy and the inspiration to go about the rest of your week in an elevated mood and with a greater feeling of ambition. The key to a puzzling relationship issue could show up, but it may come from the source of the confusion. Although that in itself may be confusing, don't question it. Since this is what you need in order to move forward, just trust in what you learn and do your best. Praise and flattery could come your way over something you did long ago. You may have felt you were overlooked at the time, and so this validation should give you a great sense of pride and accomplishment, as well as motivation to continue working on a certain project.","interval":"2020w08","reqDate":"2020w08"}]}
