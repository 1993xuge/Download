{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"This week will be all about looking forward, Aries - but not about living in the future. You are encouraged to fully embrace the here and now, but allow yourself to dream and envision what could be. This is a week to indulge your fantasies and to think about your purpose on this planet and how to fulfill it. You may find that a mentor or guidance of some sort will almost magically appear when you begin sculpting out your ideas, and once that happens, you should instinctively know which way to go. This week is also about bringing your all to a task you have been assigned or that has become your responsibility because someone else dropped the ball. Even though there may be some resentment, just focus on showing others what you are made of. Later in the week, you may need to keep reminding yourself to remain calm and cool while dealing with a frustrating person or situation. Getting all worked up will only make things more intense while approaching this matter with a serene demeanor will help you resolve it quickly.","interval":"2019w48","reqDate":"2019w48"}]}
