{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Be sure to take care of your outstanding business first this week, Sagittarius, or you may not be able to say yes to a wide array of fun activities that could come up for you. And that means not only doing your actual work that brings income, but also any outstanding issues around the house or in your personal life that need to be attended to. If you leave loose ends, you may not be able to enjoy yourself fully even if you do say yes, so get to it as soon as possible. If you are working on one particularly intense project, you may need some distractions to keep yourself going, especially when frustrating moments arise. But outlets like the invitations or chances you may receive to have fun this week, along with taking some time to plan a future fun event can keep you excited and enthusiastic enough to get through the week without getting irritated. A friend may come to you with a problem this week, but what they explain to you may not be nearly as explosive or problematic as it seems to them. Don't let them get upset, just dig in and figure out what's really happening. You don't need to fix this for anyone, but you can offer guidance. In fact, rather than dealing with this directly, having your loved one take the reins would be wise, as it will establish a more independent approach for next time. Late in the week, don't allow a moody friend or spouse to ruin your weekend. Fun events should never be tarnished by someone's bad mood.","interval":"2020w08","reqDate":"2020w08"}]}
