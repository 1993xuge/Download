{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may be envious whenever you meet someone who makes decisions easily. You may be someone who agonizes over every decision hoping to make the perfect choice. That may be because you can see all sides of most situations, and because you see more, there is more to assess. Don't be ashamed of that, Pisces. Don't tell yourself that this is some kind of a deficit. Others may make choices quickly, but you make choices deeply, and in the end, you are usually happier with what you decide. Take your time when you feel you need it. That may be a message you need to hear now.","interval":"20200402","reqDate":"20200402"}]}
