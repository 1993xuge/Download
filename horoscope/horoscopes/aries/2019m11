{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"A lot may be going on behind the scenes on your behalf this month, dear Aries. Whether you have seen signs of this or not, you need to express gratitude to the universe for the way your life is unfolding this month. This subtle, quiet help is quite powerful, and it may be in the form of seemingly coincidental happenings or people who appear to help you out. But whatever the source, the things that are occurring for you have the ability to transform your life in many ways. Try to remain as aware as possible of what is going on, and take advantage of any outright opportunities that come to you. This month may also see an escalation in a situation that has dragged on for too long. You may be presented with the chance to resolve a problem, and even though the obvious answer may not be the one you envisioned or hoped for, it could offer you an excellent solution to a problem. A money matter or a legal issue that caused you some concern last month may reach a conclusion this month as well. While there may be some confusion over how this transpires, if you do your due diligence, you will get to the bottom of it and recognize that it was the best thing that could have happened. Don't ignore a conversation that comes up casually this month when someone voices a level of dissatisfaction with something that affects both of you, even if it is subtle. Fixing this now will be beneficial to everyone involved.","interval":"2019m11","reqDate":"2019m11"}]}
