{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Do not believe everything you hear this week, Aquarius, because the rumor mill may be churning overtime. Even if something you hear seems credible, it may only contain remnants of the truth, and falling for it could cause issues in a relationship that is important to you. In fact, just waiting and watching would be your best approach rather than addressing the matter directly, for you will see and hear what's going on more accurately this way. At the end of it, you will probably breathe a sigh of relief. Someone that you thought might not come through for you could be a champion and get something done despite your doubts. Be expressive in your gratitude, and let them know how much it means to you. A current goal that you have gotten behind on pursuing could gain steam quickly this week. If you devote the right time and energy to this, it could gain momentum and become quite a force very soon, perhaps even before the week ends. This could lead to some amazing connections if you take the time to network as you go. You may also want to think about curbing your spending habits this week because there may be an opportunity to invest or to make an important purchase that will be quite meaningful to you very soon. Being able to respond with this immediately, rather than having to scramble or borrow funds, will offer a great sense of satisfaction.","interval":"2020w05","reqDate":"2020w05"}]}
