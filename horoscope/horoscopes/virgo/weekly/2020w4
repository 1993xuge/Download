{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may have a strong desire to collaborate with someone this week on a project that is near and dear to your heart. While you may have had a plan to do this independently, Virgo, you may encounter someone who shares your vision and has the same goal that is so important to you. Don't be afraid to reach out and express how you feel to this person about partnering up, because you may find that they reciprocate your feelings. A relationship that is important to you may be taking a long time to grow closer, even though you wish you could form a stronger bond more quickly. But this is not a reflection of anyone's desire to remain distant. This may be more about the kind of person this is, and they may prefer to move slowly for fear of rejection or making a mistake. Just enjoy the time spent together and continue to build a foundation for future closeness. This week may offer you a pivotal chance to grow a bit closer in a significant way. If you have an important decision to make, this is not the best week to make that decision. It is, however, a perfect time to gather information, weigh options, and look introspectively at what will be best for you. You should be ready soon to move forward on this with great confidence.","interval":"2020w04","reqDate":"2020w04"}]}
