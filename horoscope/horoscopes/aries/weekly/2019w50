{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"No matter how far you go and no matter how many hoops you jump through in your efforts to help someone understand you, dear Aries, they may never understand you. That could mean that there will always be struggles and conflicts in the future. This week, this is a relationship that you may want to evaluate - or reevaluate. Bear in mind that you may wind up defending yourself a lot if you choose to keep on keeping on. You probably have more important things to do with your time, but that's totally up to you. You could receive an unexpected apology this week, but you may question whether it is sincere or not. However, consider that it really doesn't matter at this point if that apology is sincere, and just accept it as though it is. Once they see you express relief and satisfaction because of the apology, a truly sincere feeling about wanting to apologize may come later. You may have carried a grudge about this for some time, but it is time to let it go. Later in the week, you may find yourself losing your temper over something really silly. This might be an indication that there is an issue with this person that you have never had the nerve to bring up, and it needs to be dealt with because the anger is lingering. A breakthrough with a learning experience could come through for you this week. Something you have been struggling to master could suddenly click and become much easier.","interval":"2019w50","reqDate":"2019w50"}]}
