{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"This week, Aries, you may find yourself feeling especially conscious of your image and your reputation. Maybe you are hopeful about impressing someone, such as a romantic partner or interest, or you are thinking of making a change in business or your professional life. It is always powerful to feel your best, both appearance-wise and in the way you approach others. Although you are someone who is almost always composed, work on whatever you perceive to be your weaknesses to build your confidence. You may receive some positive and complimentary feedback this week that will help to uplift your self-esteem. There could be inklings of some unique opportunity coming your way, and while it may not arrive this week, you should have ample notice to prepare for it, and that would be a great thing to work on now. You may have the sense this week that someone you meet is hiding behind an invisible mask. They may not be forthcoming on a personal level, which could make you feel a lack of trust for them. But try to understand that some folks just aren't comfortable sharing that level of engagement early on, try to be open to what this person can offer. They could wind up playing an important role in your life.","interval":"2020w15","reqDate":"2020w15"}]}
