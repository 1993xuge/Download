{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"No guts or glory could be your theme this week, Moonchild. You have to be brave at times and fight your fears to get what you want in life - especially the bigger and more important things. But if you allow your optimistic spirit to shine through and you keep repeating positive mantras and affirmations to yourself, you can tackle something that has held you back for a long time, and you will surprise yourself! This is a great time to start the new year right by getting into the habit of nourishing your spirit, your body, and your soul all at the same time. Don't neglect one for the other, and start taking special care of yourself. In other words, treat yourself in the same way that you tend to treat everyone else that you love. You deserve it. If getting fiscally fit has been on your mind in recent weeks, this is a great week to start creating a plan that will allow you to achieve that goal. In fact, you can set out a year-long plan that should include not just your expected everyday expenses, but you can also budget in entertainment, gifts, special nights out, and other indulgences for yourself. If you follow it closely, by this time next year - and even before then - you will feel empowered and far more secure. If a new job or even a change of career has been on your mind, this is a great week to start exploring what you might like to do. Inquiries sent out this week should result in at least a few positive responses.","interval":"2020w03","reqDate":"2020w03"}]}
