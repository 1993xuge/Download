{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may feel like lashing out at someone who has long been a source of trouble in your life. Maybe this person is manipulative or always has ulterior motives - to the point where there is no real trust. Some might tell you to hold it in, but if this feeling has built up in you over a long period of time, and if you have been taken advantage of, it might make you feel better to have your say. But if you do, just be sure that you speak up in a classy way by simply stating the facts and expressing the way it all made you feel. Let it out, dear Pisces.","interval":"20200323","reqDate":"20200323"}]}
