And once it becomes a habit, that worry becomes like a groove in your mind, and it can be a hard thing to climb out of. It's time to avoid this problem, Aquarius, and refuse to give in to worry.

Don't let a current negative possibility become a worry. Nip it in the bud.","interval":"20191129","reqDate":"20191129"}]}
