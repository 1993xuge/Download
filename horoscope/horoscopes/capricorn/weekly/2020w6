{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Are you in, or are you out? That may be the question someone keeps nagging you about this week, Capricorn. They want you to join their team, side with them, partner with them, or join them in something that you may feel unsure about. Whether this is related to business or not, you do need to clarify the figurative \"fine print\" before you get involved, or you could find that this takes up more of your time and energy than you think it will. The big question will be whether it is worth it or not. It may be, but be sure before you commit. A primary relationship of yours may be feeling stuck. You would probably prefer to avoid talking about a certain subject while the other party may want nothing more than to talk about it. However, you may be able to meet somewhere in the middle by edging into this slowly and trying to acclimate yourself before baring your soul. Expressing how you feel is not always easy for you, but if you take it slow and easy with just a bit of conversation when you feel comfortable, you may be able to have a reasonably productive conversation before the week is over. Someone's proposition or offer may catch you by surprise, and you could feel cornered in a way. You may want to say yes simply to avoid the awkwardness of saying no, but don't take anything on right now that you don't feel very good about. You have a lot on your plate, and you will have more soon. If you streamline your obligations, you will wind up being far more productive.","interval":"2020w06","reqDate":"2020w06"}]}
