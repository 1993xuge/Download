{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Don't be tempted to follow a friend or a family member down an emotional rabbit hole this week, Libra. Because of your empathy, you may want to sympathize with someone's predicament and help out as best you can, but getting too entangled in this could drag you down as well. Be supportive, but don't cause yourself undue anxiety. A truth that has been hidden from you may come out into the open this week rather unexpectedly. Someone may say something that gives you a strong clue that you can follow until you discover what really happened, and that could be quite satisfying. Don't waste your time this week on a person who is more of a taker than a giver, or you will wind up being the giver throughout any shared endeavors. That means that you will carry the burden of a venture you take on, and it could be more than you anticipated. Do something just for yourself this week. Think of your own future and your own interests, and follow those exclusively. Scattering your energy this week is not advised - do what is best for you first. A conversation late in the week could enlighten you as to how highly someone thinks of you, and that should be a true gift.","interval":"2019w48","reqDate":"2019w48"}]}
