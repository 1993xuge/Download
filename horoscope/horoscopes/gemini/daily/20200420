{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"We have all seen some version of the shell game. A hustler puts a pea beneath a shell or a cup, and then shuffles it around quickly, and a player - who puts money down on his bet - has to guess under which shell or cup the pea winds up. It seems easy, but the huckster's hands move so quickly and in such a distracting way that the player is likely to lose track.

The stars say there is deception around you today, so be careful around someone who might have something to gain, Gemini.","interval":"20200420","reqDate":"20200420"}]}
