If this year has been good to you, you may feel like you are on a roll, and that your good fortune can continue. But if your year wasn't as good as you hoped it would be, you may be fearful of more of the same. If you can pause for a second and dissect that fear, you will see that it is nonsensical. Therefore, neither scenario makes sense. You don't get more of anything because you have already experienced it. Wipe the notion of good luck or bad luck out of your mind. Give yourself the power to create your own luck.","interval":"20191231","reqDate":"20191231"}]}
