{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Throughout this month, Taurus, you may find yourself thinking more deeply about money matters and about personal relationships. Although these two things might not intersect, they will both carry equal value in terms of analysis this month. You could be formulating a plan for greater financial security or better spending and saving habits, which is always a good thing. And as for your personal relationships, you may be contemplating certain aspects that seem to repeat with many of the people you know and love. This is more about you though, and getting what you want and need out of these important connections. At some point this month, a mystery may keep you guessing. But the more you think about it, the more confusing it may become - that is until some hidden truth is uncovered and everything begins to make perfect sense. You may have recently expanded your horizons in one particular area of your life, and in December this newfound sense of confidence and enthusiasm should begin to pay off for you with the chance to apply what you have learned. You may have cursed your bad luck in winding up with a particularly aggravating obligation in recent weeks, but this month you may begin to see the hidden treasure in it. You may also pour yourself more fully into it, recognizing just how much richer your life can be because of it.","interval":"2019m12","reqDate":"2019m12"}]}
