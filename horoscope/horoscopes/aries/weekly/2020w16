{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may be concerned that an endeavor you have put a lot of energy into has uncertain potential, dear Aries. At times you may wonder if it has all been a waste of your time. This week, you should experience renewed hope and optimism for this project. And this happens to be a perfect time to jump-start this again, perhaps in a slightly different way, or in a somewhat different direction. Good things lie ahead for this if you persevere. This week may have its share of ups and downs in your personal relationships, but you should find that even the downs hold the possibility of something positive, for they could draw you closer to someone and help you understand them better. A productive conversation regarding a business or legal matter could ensue this week. Just keep your cool, and if you don't like the person involved, make sure the conversation is all about the topic, and don't make it about the person. If you can do that, you will prevail and feel much better about it. If you have been having buyer's remorse over a purchase made in the recent past, you may need to get over it. It could be too late to undo it, and you may yet find that it was a wise decision.","interval":"2020w16","reqDate":"2020w16"}]}
