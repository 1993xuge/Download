You may be pondering thoughts like this throughout this week, Taurus. And through this wondering, you might begin to focus on your own special role in this amazing life. Something is changing, and this week the changes may begin to become far more apparent. Welcome this evolution of your spirit with grace and gratitude, for it is all leading someplace better - someplace where you belong. Don't be afraid of this change. A gesture of respect or appreciation could catch you off guard this week, but this could be a very pleasant surprise. Perhaps you have not felt very appreciated recently in some area of your life, but this could lift your spirit back up. An encounter and subsequent conversation could lead you to solve a riddle that has been puzzling you. Although this chat might have nothing to do with the actual problem you need to resolve, something that is said could give you an inkling of how to figure this out. Throughout this week, be sure to maintain a schedule. Upcoming events will require you to be able to spontaneously accept invitations, and having everything in order will allow you to do so.","interval":"2019w49","reqDate":"2019w49"}]}
