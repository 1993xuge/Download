{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Big changes may be unfolding this week in an area of your life that is extremely important and central to your sense of security and overall happiness. This could be related to finances, relationships, or both. Although the news is coming, don't draw any conclusions at first because a true sense of how good this will be can't be formed until you can see the big picture. Yes, a lot is taking place, and you should finally feel like the universe has your back and that your happiness is being protected. This is a big score for you, but it has come to you through your own hard work and positive efforts and beliefs. Celebrate with each bit of good news you receive, Sagittarius. You have given away some of your power recently on a matter that became too frustrating to deal with. You may have agreed to something that left you feeling empty or defeated, and then just let it go. But you may have a chance this week to reclaim your power and to do what you wanted to do in the first place. Be assertive and believe in yourself when this chance arrives. Conflict is possible with an argument that arises with a family member or a close friend this week, but you can and should avoid it. Take the peaceful path by not even discussing it if the matter seems to become inflamed. It isn't worth your peace of mind, and it will work out best if you leave well enough alone. If you are offered a chance that aligns with one of your goals, take it. Even if others disagree with how good this could be for you, you know that it feels right.","interval":"2020w09","reqDate":"2020w09"}]}
