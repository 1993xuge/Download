To you, home is security, love, comfort, coziness, tradition, and so much more. Although many people are this way, for you that feeling is usually much more elevated. If you have become stuck in a rut right now, you can take even more comfort in your home. Do something to spruce it up. Bake something aromatic. Rearrange the furniture. Light a fire and enjoy a cup of tea. Do whatever it takes to cozy up to the warmth your home brings you.","interval":"20200418","reqDate":"20200418"}]}
