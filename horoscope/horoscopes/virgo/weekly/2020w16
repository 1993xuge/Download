{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You will have to face the realities of one of your primary relationships this week. This may be a conflicted relationship and one that you have always wished to improve. But even though you have a heartfelt desire to make things better, you probably have not taken any action as of yet. This week could provide an excellent opportunity to do just that because there is a general atmosphere of cooperation and strength in reconciliations. Have hope if you reach out to someone because a hopeful heart is always rewarded in the best way possible. You may be overly concerned by a close family member or friend who does not want to be fretted over. Your concerns may not be valid, as you may be filling in the blanks in your mind with an issue the other party does not want to talk about. Leave it alone, and you will receive validation that all is well as things improve. You may have written off a debt or a favor someone owed you long ago since it never materialized. But this week, you could see it repaid, or at least the desire to repay it could be expressed.","interval":"2020w16","reqDate":"2020w16"}]}
