{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may find yourself at odds with someone at the beginning of the week, Aquarius, and that is certainly not the most comfortable place to be. You are not someone who attacks when provoked - you are more likely to turn the other cheek. But you may be so riled by something that is said to you that you may have the urge to lash out. Actually, that wouldn't be a bad idea, especially if you are dealing with someone who is treating you unfairly. So, speak what is on your mind in your very direct way, and you may make a change for the better in a complicated relationship. Your humble way of doing for others without taking credit for it may be noticed by someone important this week, leading them to praise you or offer you an opportunity you won't be able to resist. You don't like to be in the spotlight, but this is your chance to show who you are and to continue to build your reputation for future ventures where trust is essential. You may be seeking funding for a home project or some change to your lifestyle, and this is the week to think deeply about that. If money is a major concern for you, you may want to get creative and start exploring ways you can do this yourself - either with a few close friends or through a bartering arrangement. If you can expand your options and\/or find a creative approach, you may not have to spend much at all.","interval":"2020w10","reqDate":"2020w10"}]}
