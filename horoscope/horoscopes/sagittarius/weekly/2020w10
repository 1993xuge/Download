{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Money is a constant in the minds of most people. We think about how to get it, how to keep it, how to get more of it, what we can buy with it, and on and on. For you this week, Sagittarius, money may be a primary concern. There may be some issues associated with your financial status that you want to fix or want to change, and you can get that going in the days ahead. This is most likely to be about not just building a stronger financial foundation, but also about acquiring something you want very badly. Opportunities are coming, though they may not arrive for a while. In the meantime, start brainstorming what and how you want to handle your monetary ascent. You are smart in this way, so do so with confidence and look for guidance as well. Your social circle may be increasing, perhaps through family connections. You could meet someone through a sibling who you find most interesting. And although there may be a bit of sibling or other rivalry involved, this is a connection you should pursue. Just try to be nice and considerate about it, and be willing to share your newfound friend. You may need space from someone in your life who has been very irritating and dramatic in recent days or weeks. You want space from this person, but that may only perpetuate the problem and make things even more friction-filled. Instead, try talking it out to figure it out, and then you can actually do something to change it.","interval":"2020w10","reqDate":"2020w10"}]}
