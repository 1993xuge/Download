{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Watch what you say and how you say it this week, Moonchild because people are listening. If you accidentally reveal something that you would rather keep private, or if you convey something in a way that is not easily understood by others, you could wind up fighting off gossip. It would be easier to simply be mindful of your words before you speak. You are in control of this, so no need to worry if you remain aware. If you have an important activity or project coming up, this is the week to start planning it. You might tend to put off getting this done because there are some elements to it that are less than exciting, but procrastinating will only create trouble where there does not have to be any trouble. So, get to it! Turn on the charm toward the middle of the week if you have to deal with a difficult person. Your charm - although very endearing - is also very low-key and subtle. Stressed-out people tend to respond best to this type of vibe, so be as sweet and caring as you can be, and you can relate to anyone quite successfully this week. If you have been waiting to receive an answer to a work or legal-related matter, it could arrive this week. Will it be the answer you are hoping for? Maybe. Maybe not. But the good news is that it will ultimately be exactly what is right for you at this moment, so take heart.","interval":"2020w07","reqDate":"2020w07"}]}
