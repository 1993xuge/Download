But if you arranged a blind date that went badly, you might be blamed even though your intentions would have been hopeful and positive, and blame would be unwarranted. Likewise, if the advice you have given to someone did not work out well, you should not blame yourself. You had the best intentions when you gave the advice.

Deal with it once the result becomes apparent, and even if things don't go as you thought they would - don't feel bad.","interval":"20191220","reqDate":"20191220"}]}
