{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Someone in a role of authority may seem like the bane of your existence this month, Gemini - at least at first. You may argue and struggle within certain limits in your efforts to deal with this individual, but a big change is coming. That's why it is important that you do not go to any extremes in your reactions. The more level and low-key you are in your dealings, the more your calm demeanor will be recognized and appreciated, and this should turn out quite well because of that. You may have to make a big choice in a relationship this month. This may be something you have put off for a long time because you feared it would be too difficult because you were confused about what to do or because you did not want to rock the boat. But once you get down to business figuring this out, the right choice will become very easy and very obvious. A financial matter that has been questionable may have a very happy ending this month with certain confusing issues answered in a very satisfactory way with the resolution you had hoped for. You may be hoping to connect with someone romantically. Whether this is a new relationship or an established bond, you may have aspirations of growing closer. For most of the month, you may not have the chance to arrange any special times together, but by the end of the month, some very special romantic moments should become possible.","interval":"2019m11","reqDate":"2019m11"}]}
