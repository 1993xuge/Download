{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"At times throughout your life, Pisces, you have felt like a square peg trying to fit into a round hole, particularly when dealing with certain aspects of \"the system\". This is one of the difficulties of being such a unique individual. The secret to happiness is to embrace the ways that you are different and to celebrate your extraordinary qualities. Your many virtues are becoming apparent to someone who has the power to make something happen for you. This week, your beautiful uniqueness will be on center stage, and opportunities could flow to you that will enable you to express your talents, perhaps for financial rewards down the road. Let your flag fly high. There is no doubt that you can manifest a dream in your life. Others may doubt you, but deep down you know that you can do it. However, the question is not if you can do it, but whether this is the right time or not. Someone could enter your life this week that can help guide you to the right decision about this. Keep in mind this week that what someone says is only second to what they actually do. Someone may be doing a lot of talking and making a lot of promises, but you need to wait until you see some action on their part before you buy into what they are trying to convince you of. Don't allow anyone to instigate trouble with you late in the week when a family matter or a money-related matter comes up. Calmly collect your thoughts and deal with it as you see fit without getting aggravated. This should turn out fine.","interval":"2019w50","reqDate":"2019w50"}]}
