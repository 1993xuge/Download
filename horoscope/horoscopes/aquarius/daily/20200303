{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Someone may be trying to win you over to their side of an argument, Aquarius. They may be doing this through gentle pressure and subliminal manipulation. Since you prefer to like the people you meet, and you want them to like you, this can be hard. You would love to be able to believe in someone, and so you can easily be swayed. But if you sense that someone may be trying to coerce you, you have to take it seriously. Don't allow anyone to lead you down a misty path that you have doubts about. Use your intellect and your intuition to protect yourself.","interval":"20200303","reqDate":"20200303"}]}
