{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"If you have been contemplating a new venture, Leo, you may find yourself feeling readier than ever this week to put yourself out there. It isn't that you are shy - that's not the case at all. It's more about you feeling that your ideas have not yet \"fermented\". But now things are coming together and the ideas may be coming to you in rapid fire, and you can feel your creative blood flowing. Take advantage of this vibration by getting to work as quickly as you can. There are reasons you feel so good about this as you will discover if you see it through. Someone in your life may aspire to be like you in some area where you excel. Even so, you can see that this individual has not paid their dues as you have. If you put it that way, though, you may bring out that person's jealousy; whereas if you are gently encouraging and show them the proper steps, you could become an excellent mentor, and that could help you polish your own skills. Someone may be admiring you from a distance this week - well, isn't that always the case? It may seem that way, but this week there is someone who has a very special attraction to you that may have to do with a talent you possess that is unlike any other. This may not be a romantic attraction, but rather an attraction coming from someone who wants to partner with you on a project or seek out advice. Follow through to see where it leads.","interval":"2020w12","reqDate":"2020w12"}]}
