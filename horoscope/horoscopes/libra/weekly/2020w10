{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"As you enter this week, Libra, you may find yourself preoccupied with pondering what happened last week. You may be unhappy with the way something played out, and you may keep playing it over and over again in your head. But that isn't going to change anything, and frankly, it is a waste of your time. Concentrate on the here and now. This week, you should have a chance to undo any perceived damages and start something fresh without fear or hesitation. You may even find that someone comes to you who can help you out with aspects that are not clear to you, and that could make a huge difference. Maintain a positive attitude as always, and you will do well. A partnership and collaboration will be emphasized this week. This may not be the forming of a new partnership or new collaboration, but rather the reconciliation of an old one. On many levels, you worked quite well together, but there may have been a point where you diverged and handled it all wrong on both sides. You may have a chance to come back together this week. If you have to reach out yourself, then do so, because this could be a magical union with the potential to collaborate very creatively together. This may also be a week when you realize that distancing yourself or even separating from someone you are not getting along with would be a good idea. But this will not be permanent. It will, however, give you a chance to come to appreciate each other once again and find a better way to relate.","interval":"2020w10","reqDate":"2020w10"}]}
