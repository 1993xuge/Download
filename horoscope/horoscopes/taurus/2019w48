{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may have dealt with a lot of confusion and emotional chaos in the last week or two, Taurus, but that is winding down now. This week, you should find that the tone and energy are more relaxed and easier, and any tensions should fall away. This could be because a challenging matter is being resolved, and you can sense it. Even if this is happening behind the scenes, things are falling into place, and there is a general sense of order once again. Be hopeful. This is a week when you could attract a lot of attention. This may be because you are coming into your own with a particular project that is close to your heart, and it is giving you an outward glow to match your inward glow. This is a great thing, and you need to keep moving forward with it because it can bring you happiness and personal fulfillment. You may have the chance this week to compete in some way to attain something you want very much. You may not see yourself as a competitive person, but you may find yourself rising to the occasion and giving it all you've got.","interval":"2019w48","reqDate":"2019w48"}]}
