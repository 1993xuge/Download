{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"If you find yourself feeling extra-sensitive early this week, then it would be wise to limit those interactions and activities that could bring out your more difficult emotions. You may have a lot on your mind in these first few weeks of the new year, and you may be feeling especially sentimental and nostalgic. Give yourself some time to ponder and think back over the last year and center yourself for what you want your life to be like in the year ahead. If you give yourself the time to just feel whatever you naturally feel, it can be quite eye-opening for you, and by the end of the week, you should start to feel stronger and more confident. If you feel that you need an emotional outlet this week, try to steer yourself toward creative expression. Even if you don't have any specific creative skills, painting a picture or writing your thoughts down in poetry form can be very calming. A relationship that could be very important to you is in the process of developing, and you recognize this - but don't push it or rush it to become something idealized. Just let it bloom naturally, and you will be happy with what it turns out to be. A certain venture could be so much more fulfilling and successful if you can find a way to put just a bit more time into it.","interval":"2020w02","reqDate":"2020w02"}]}
