Any chance to debate or argue gets their blood racing, and they often engage in conversations. It doesn't necessarily mean that they are not good people, just that they have developed a way of engaging that is not pleasant to anyone.

But do respond in the most pleasant manner possible, and you may make a wonderful and lasting impression on someone who matters.","interval":"20200307","reqDate":"20200307"}]}
