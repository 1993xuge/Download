{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You are always a rather popular person, Gemini, but this week you may find yourself in even higher demand among colleagues, friends, and family members. There may be invitations to special events, outings, and even requests for your special brand of inspiration by many of the people in your world. And your magnetism may be so extra-high this week that you could draw strangers into your orbit who could evolve into longtime friends. Enjoy the commotion. You may have been considering getting involved in some sort of a charitable pursuit in recent weeks or months, and this is a great week to begin exploring what you might want to do. You could lend your expertise in some area, perhaps, or just volunteer your time to a worthy cause. There could be a myriad of rewards. Be wary of a power struggle that could occur at work or in a family dynamic. Someone wants to be in charge of something that you have probably always handled, and there could be a lot of friction if you and your position are challenged. Hold your own because you landed in this role for a good reason. You are the best one to proceed as things are, but it probably wouldn't hurt to make a challenger feel more important. Everyone wants to feel that they have something of value to contribute, so including them in brainstorming and asking for assistance could be the answer to resolving this peacefully.","interval":"2020w12","reqDate":"2020w12"}]}
