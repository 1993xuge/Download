{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"If you have been feeling a bit out of sorts recently - perhaps just fatigued or lacking in mental clarity - it may seemingly be from being overwrought at work, in your personal life, or just because there are worries you are not dealing with properly. This is a great week to take a fresh clear look at what might be bothering you, Libra, and then take steps to remedy it. Working through some of this can be cathartic and lift a heavy weight off your shoulders. Get started as early in the week as possible. If you come to the conclusion that someone or something in your life is draining you emotionally - such as your job, a relationship, or anything else - this is a good time to start facing this and take steps to set things right. It is never good to allow something to get out of control to the point where it affects your emotional well-being, because that can lead to physical problems as well. If you feel that you can't move forward and away from something that is bothering you because of security-related issues, then this is a good week to find something that can fill in the blanks for you and make everything okay. At certain times of the year, a gardener will prune back shrubbery and other plants so that new growth can occur, and this is just that kind of time for you.","interval":"2020w04","reqDate":"2020w04"}]}
