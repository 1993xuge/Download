{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"Life is not a dress rehearsal, Aquarius, and this week it is time to finally get moving with an enterprise you have spent a lot of time fantasizing about. You have probably had a lot of fun imagining all of the wonderful things that could materialize when you finally put your plan into action, but realistically speaking, it is not going to go anywhere if you don't get it started. This week, if you are open to moving forward, you should find that information, guidance, and resources could fall into your path enabling you to find your way. The access you need to begin a passion project may also become available to you this week. Some connection you may have attempted to make long ago should suddenly spring into view opening a brief window of opportunity. Even though you may be busy, don't hesitate to do whatever may be necessary to take advantage of this. There may be a chance this week for you to advance at work or in some other important and\/or lucrative venture, but it will require you to blow your own horn, so to speak. Don't be shy about touting your many virtues, skills and talents, for the braver and bolder you are, the more likely this will work out for you. You are someone who has very high standards, but perhaps you have been a bit rough on someone who has a hard time doing something as well as you do. But rather than pointing out mistakes, help this person by showing rather than telling. The rewards will be quite fulfilling.","interval":"2019w51","reqDate":"2019w51"}]}
