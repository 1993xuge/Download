{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"This week, Aries, you need to focus on your income and debts and find a way to reconcile your finances that brings you a greater sense of security and confidence in your future. You may have worries now that surround material things and money. If you take charge, though, and you take a thorough look at where you stand, you can come up with a plan that will give you a powerful feeling of being in control. It probably won't take much work, and you should consult someone with expertise if you need to - but once you get this done, you will have a plan which will bring a sense of relief and purpose. Someone you turn to as a mentor or a guide may have some important insight to share with you now. Perhaps you have been searching for an answer to an important question, and maybe you would prefer to keep it quiet, but if you do reach out, you should find the knowledge you need to take essential steps. A lot may be riding on an answer you are waiting on now, and it may seem to be taking forever. Work on being more patient, for it will come to you at the right time. Focus on something entirely different now to avoid generating negative energy about this.","interval":"2020w17","reqDate":"2020w17"}]}
