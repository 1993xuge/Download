{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may find yourself feeling torn this week when two friends or loved ones ask you to take up sides for them, Capricorn. Although there may be elements of each person's argument that you can agree with, the very act of siding with one over the other could start a battle you don't want to be a part of. It would be far more beneficial to gracefully bow out of this competition and allow them to settle it for themselves. You may be feeling a bit adventurous this week. Perhaps you saw a show on television or read a story about some exotic location that you would like to visit. Although it may not be possible to start making tangible plans, this is a good time to start exploring the places you would like to go and begin planning an itinerary. Even though you can't fly off just yet, you can gain greater enjoyment from the process of searching and planning a trip for the future. A sentimental moment may occur this week between you and a special someone when an old memory arises that could bring you closer together and reignite some of the plans you had that fell by the wayside. This would be an excellent idea. If you haven't begun a bucket list yet, this is a great week to start thinking about it. This could be a great diversion from the obligations you have on your plate this week, and the fun of coming up with your list could put a smile on your face.","interval":"2019w51","reqDate":"2019w51"}]}
