{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"This week, Sagittarius, it might dawn on you that someone in your life is not - and has not - been there for you in the way they had always been in the past. This realization may come as a shock to your system and might bring on a bout of melancholy. But it may not be that your perception is real. You may find, if you quietly seek out information, that there is something distracting your loved one that has nothing at all to do with you. Be patient and things should return to normal very soon. A challenge with a money matter could come up for you this week, but with a bit of financial creativity, you can figure out a way to rise above the situation - and you will do just fine. You may find yourself feeling skeptical of the compliments or flattery you receive from someone this week. But why would you doubt that someone holds you in such high esteem? You are an admirable person with many strengths and talents, and you need to start seeing yourself in the same way that others see you. Work on that this week. If you do, you may start to see that admiration for the truth it represents.","interval":"2019w47","reqDate":"2019w47"}]}
