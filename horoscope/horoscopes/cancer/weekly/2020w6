{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may have no clue about this yet, Moonchild, but you are hovering on the edge of a big victory. You may not see it because it has taken you so long to get to this point, and you have become disillusioned and disoriented. But this week, you should begin to see that something you once had great hope for is much bigger and potentially more lucrative than you ever realized. Put as much of your energy into completing this as you can this week, because once it gets out there, things should start moving at the speed of light. A do-over may be possible with a friendship matter that has been bothering you. Something that was said or done in a certain way may have rubbed someone the wrong way, and you should have a chance this week to start from scratch. This time, each of you must be more sensitive to the feelings of the other, and this will go better. Being such a paternal\/maternal figure in the lives of so many people, you are often one who mentors or watches out for the actions of those you love. This week a younger person might be doing or saying something you see as unwise. However, you will have to restrain yourself from doing anything drastic, and this may be a learning experience that they really need to have. Intervene only if you see an absolute need, and then offer guidance rather than criticism. That will be very appreciated.","interval":"2020w06","reqDate":"2020w06"}]}
