{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You are assertive and strong-willed, Aries. You exude positive energy, and you have the amazing ability to inspire others with your drive and self-confidence. You may have the chance to do that for someone very soon. Even if helping someone in this way may not fit into your schedule now, the stars are encouraging you to find a way - even if it means doing so from a distance through encouragement. When you feel confident in yourself, you are able to motivate others. And while doing this for someone else may take some of your time, it builds positive karma and fuels your own sense of self-esteem and fulfillment.","interval":"20200411","reqDate":"20200411"}]}
