{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"You may wind up sharing a victory this week - and center stage - with someone who is happy to take all the credit. You can be quite humble and you tend to modestly present yourself, so you are not someone who will think to grab the glory from someone else. However, Virgo, it would behoove you to stake your claim in the spotlight this week because someone with great connections may be watching you and seeing whether you stand up for yourself or not. Stand up for yourself! You don't necessarily need to create a conflict or a confrontation, but you should definitely look out for your interests and your reputation. A slow-simmering conflict could come to a full boil this week. But that does not mean that it has to ruin your week. If you simmer down before engaging with someone who is having a temper-tantrum, then you can get down to the heart of the matter and resolve it without any lasting trauma. Love and romance are likely to be on your mind and your agenda this week. If you are attached, you may receive an invitation to a romantic outing from your partner, and it may be just what you two need to get cozier. And if you are single, you won't be left out. There may be someone you could meet through a mutual friend or some group you belong to who will strike your fancy. Bad news on a negotiation or an effort you initiated recently may give you the blues, but not for long. This could lead to something much better and significantly more enjoyable.","interval":"2020w11","reqDate":"2020w11"}]}
