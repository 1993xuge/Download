{"status":"ok","data":[{"type":"general","reading":"This week, Virgo, it may seem as though the writing is on the wall related to a decision that has been made, and you may not be happy about it. However, something could change out of the blue turning things around for you dramatically. While this may be uplifting news to you, just be sure you clarify everything thoroughly so that you can be sure you can handle it all and be happy with the way things will go. Travel could be on your mind this week. You may have the urge to get away to a sandy beach where you can just recline on a plush towel with a good book and listen to the sound of the waves crashing on the shoreline. This may have to wait, of course, because you probably have a lot of responsibilities right now. However, there is nothing to stop you from fantasizing and dreaming about doing this sometime soon. In fact, you could start paging through travel brochures to find the perfect destination, which will give you a lovely dream to look forward to. A friend or an acquaintance who may come across as very level-headed and grounded could come to you with an invitation to partner up on a certain project. But just because you trust and believe in this person's reliability, does not mean the project itself is right for you. Think about it carefully before you commit.","interval":"2020w05","reqDate":"2020w05"}]}
